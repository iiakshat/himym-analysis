<i>Kids, when it comes to love,</i>

3
00:00:14,725 --> 00:00:17,601
<i>the best relationships are the ones
that just come naturally.</i>

4
00:00:17,696 --> 00:00:19,611
My first solo batch.

5
00:00:19,709 --> 00:00:22,361
I think those need to stay in the oven
awhile longer.

6
00:00:22,457 --> 00:00:23,767
Here's a professional tip.

7
00:00:23,863 --> 00:00:26,802
If it's still runny, it's not a cupcake.

8
00:00:26,898 --> 00:00:28,495
- It's a beverage.
- Yeah, well...

9
00:00:28,591 --> 00:00:32,233
<i>Things with Victoria were fun. And easy.
And uncomplicated.</i>

10
00:00:32,329 --> 00:00:33,319
No, no.

11
00:00:33,415 --> 00:00:35,330
<i>It was pretty great.</i>

12
00:00:40,604 --> 00:00:42,681
Are you coloring in your butt?

13
00:00:42,776 --> 00:00:46,227
I have a big interview coming up.
And my suit has holes in it.

14
00:00:46,323 --> 00:00:48,272
I can't sew. I don't own navy boxers.

15
00:00:48,367 --> 00:00:51,135
So, yeah, I'm coloring in my butt.

16
00:00:51,243 --> 00:00:53,191
- Just wear another one.
- I don't have another one.

17
00:00:53,287 --> 00:00:57,825
I'm flat broke. My only other suit options
are track or birthday.

18
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:59,933
Dude, you show up to an interview in that,

19
00:01:00,029 --> 00:01:02,904
even the hippie lawyers
from Granola Mountain Earth Pals...

20
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,790
will hacky-sack you straight out the door.

21
00:01:04,885 --> 00:01:07,249
Okay, it's
the National Resource Defense Council...

22
00:01:07,345 --> 00:01:08,911
and it's my dream job.

23
00:01:09,007 --> 00:01:11,562
Except it's only an internship
and I won't be getting paid.

24
00:01:11,658 --> 00:01:13,096
Mostly getting people coffee.

25
00:01:13,192 --> 00:01:18,560
But the people I'm getting coffee for,
their bosses are gonna save the world.

26
00:01:18,655 --> 00:01:21,818
Okay. Tomorrow... And I should mention
this is gonna rock your world.

27
00:01:21,914 --> 00:01:25,683
Tomorrow, I'm taking you
to my personal tailor.

28
00:01:26,195 --> 00:01:29,230
A tailor?
Barney, I make negative $300 a week...

29
00:01:29,326 --> 00:01:31,530
and I need every negative penny of that
for my wedding.

30
00:01:31,626 --> 00:01:33,767
Relax. My guy does everything
for one-third the cost.

31
00:01:33,863 --> 00:01:39,166
And there is no way you're getting married
in that sarcastic-quotation-marks 'suit.'

32
00:01:39,262 --> 00:01:42,007
Tomorrow. Noon. My tailor.

33
00:01:43,416 --> 00:01:45,331
No thanks, dude.

34
00:01:48,783 --> 00:01:49,709
- Noon?
- Noon.

35
00:01:49,805 --> 00:01:51,720
- Okay.
- See you then.

36
00:01:54,492 --> 00:01:54,603
Hey, girls.

37
00:01:54,699 --> 00:01:55,482
Hey, girls.

38
00:01:55,578 --> 00:01:56,568
- Hey.
- Hey.

39
00:01:56,664 --> 00:01:58,006
Hey. I'm on my way to meet Ted.

40
00:01:58,102 --> 00:02:00,179
It's our two-month-iversary,
so we're going out to dinner.

41
00:02:00,274 --> 00:02:02,607
Great. Well, that answers
all the questions I didn't ask.

42
00:02:02,703 --> 00:02:03,757
Robin.

43
00:02:03,853 --> 00:02:05,514
Oh, come on. We bust on each other.

44
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:07,782
We're just at that place
in our strong friendship.

45
00:02:07,878 --> 00:02:09,793
Really?

46
00:02:09,828 --> 00:02:11,456
Get off me.

47
00:02:11,552 --> 00:02:13,406
Oh, see? I did it again.

48
00:02:15,482 --> 00:02:17,687
What are you guys up to? Dress shopping.

49
00:02:17,783 --> 00:02:20,211
You know, I make wedding cakes
for a lot of fancy bridal shops.

50
00:02:20,307 --> 00:02:22,639
If you want, I could take you shopping.
Maybe get you a discount.

51
00:02:22,735 --> 00:02:24,428
- Really? That would be great.
- Yeah.

52
00:02:28,134 --> 00:02:30,657
I should take this. Bye. Hello?

53
00:02:30,977 --> 00:02:33,150
Hey? I thought it was gonna be
just us tomorrow.

54
00:02:33,245 --> 00:02:35,322
What's with inviting Punky Brewster?

55
00:02:35,418 --> 00:02:38,613
Robin. You've gotta get over
this Ted and Victoria thing.

56
00:02:38,709 --> 00:02:42,958
You had your chance, and now he's moved
on. Can't you just be happy for them?

57
00:02:43,054 --> 00:02:45,227
The best I can give you
is a fake smile and dead eyes.

58
00:02:45,323 --> 00:02:47,238
- Sold.
- Great.

59
00:02:50,531 --> 00:02:52,032
Victoria, what's wrong?

60
00:02:52,128 --> 00:02:56,377
I've just been offered a fellowship
at a culinary institute in Germany.

61
00:02:56,473 --> 00:02:59,955
- Wait. Germany, Europe?
- It's for two years.

62
00:03:00,051 --> 00:03:03,725
I figured I didn't have much of a chance,
'cause they don't let many Americans in,

63
00:03:03,821 --> 00:03:05,736
but I'm in.

64
00:03:05,866 --> 00:03:08,199
So, this is the Europe Germany?

65
00:03:08,294 --> 00:03:11,233
- Ted, what other Germany would it be?
- The one in Epcot?

66
00:03:11,329 --> 00:03:13,244
- Ted.
- Sorry.

67
00:03:15,099 --> 00:03:17,368
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

68
00:03:17,463 --> 00:03:19,316
I don't know if I'm gonna go.

69
00:03:19,412 --> 00:03:22,032
And, if you do,
what does that mean for us?

70
00:03:22,127 --> 00:03:24,043
I don't know.

71
00:03:24,588 --> 00:03:28,038
I just... I don't think that
long-distance really works for anyone.

72
00:03:28,134 --> 00:03:30,339
Oh, God, no. Long-distance is a lie...

73
00:03:30,435 --> 00:03:34,716
teenagers tell each other
to get laid the summer before college.

74
00:03:34,812 --> 00:03:36,846
So that leaves us with...

75
00:03:37,591 --> 00:03:40,603
Either you stay here, or we break up.

76
00:03:42,255 --> 00:03:44,170
Wow.

77
00:03:45,131 --> 00:03:47,751
Look, let's just see how things progress
and if, by September, we still...

78
00:03:47,846 --> 00:03:49,060
I have to leave on Monday.

79
00:03:49,156 --> 00:03:51,761
- Monday, September the...
- Ted.

80
00:03:54,108 --> 00:03:56,143
Do you have any thoughts?

81
00:03:56,345 --> 00:03:59,892
Maybe we should each take some time
to think about what we want.

82
00:03:59,988 --> 00:04:02,320
We'll meet up tomorrow to discuss it.

83
00:04:02,416 --> 00:04:04,173
It's a date.

84
00:04:04,269 --> 00:04:08,257
<i>And that's when
things got complicated.</i>

85
00:04:08,494 --> 00:04:11,913
- Hey, baby. How's the dress place?
- Well, everything's so fluffy and white.

86
00:04:12,009 --> 00:04:16,729
It's like shopping in a marshmallow.
How's Barney's tailor?

87
00:04:16,929 --> 00:04:20,827
Everything here is dark and sketchy,
and seems illegal.

88
00:04:20,922 --> 00:04:23,286
It's like shopping in Barney's mind.

89
00:04:23,382 --> 00:04:25,235
- Good luck, baby.
- Bye.

90
00:04:26,577 --> 00:04:27,759
Hey, Barney?

91
00:04:27,855 --> 00:04:31,434
I'm not sure about this.
A tailor in the backroom of a pet store?

92
00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:34,980
Look, do you want a quality suit
and a free rabbit or not?

93
00:04:39,868 --> 00:04:43,510
Ted, Sergei says stop moping around.
You're distracting him from his process.

94
00:04:43,606 --> 00:04:44,884
You speak Ukrainian?

95
00:04:46,450 --> 00:04:48,590
Guys. I'm kind of screwed here.

96
00:04:48,685 --> 00:04:52,488
I don't wanna lose Victoria,
but I can't ask her to stay just for me.

97
00:04:52,583 --> 00:04:54,565
And long-distance definitely isn't an option.

98
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:57,823
No, no, no. No way.
You know who likes long-distance?

99
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:01,114
Girls. It's all talking and no sex.
Kill me now.

100
00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:03,446
Hey, don't knock
long-distance relationships.

101
00:05:03,542 --> 00:05:05,139
I really think they can work.

102
00:05:05,235 --> 00:05:06,961
- Really? You?
- Absolutely.

103
00:05:07,056 --> 00:05:09,964
I'm juggling four right now.
There's Lisa in Madrid.

104
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:13,414
There's Erica in Tokyo.
There's Laura in Denmark.

105
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:15,545
And Kelly on 34th Street.

106
00:05:16,162 --> 00:05:17,312
The lass thinks

107
00:05:17,408 --> 00:05:20,283
I'm a humble sheep shearer from Killarney.

108
00:05:20,379 --> 00:05:21,785
Ted, do you remember in college,

109
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:23,990
when Lily did that summer art program
in Paris?

110
00:05:24,086 --> 00:05:25,012
Yeah.

111
00:05:25,107 --> 00:05:28,047
Well, she kept talking
about this cheesy French guy, Gabrielle.

112
00:05:28,143 --> 00:05:30,028
So, I went out to visit
and there was this party.

113
00:05:30,124 --> 00:05:31,913
And who shows up but Gabrielle.

114
00:05:32,009 --> 00:05:35,236
And he's got this weak-ass,
thin, French moustache.

115
00:05:35,332 --> 00:05:38,750
Yeah, I'm not much of a fighter, but I knew
I could take this weird little dude.

116
00:05:38,846 --> 00:05:41,657
So, I took him aside,
and I got all creepy quiet...

117
00:05:41,753 --> 00:05:45,090
and got the crazy eyes going. And I said,

118
00:05:45,587 --> 00:05:49,070
'You stay away from Lily.
Or, I swear to God,

119
00:05:49,166 --> 00:05:53,383
'I'll eat that moustache
right off of your ugly French face.'

120
00:05:53,478 --> 00:05:57,025
Yeah. No, he literally ran away.
I think he was crying.

121
00:05:57,121 --> 00:06:01,977
I never told Lily about it.
To be honest, I'm not very proud of it.

122
00:06:02,073 --> 00:06:04,433
To be even more honest, I am.

123
00:06:06,003 --> 00:06:08,463
Other than confirming a lot of European
stereotypes about Americans,

124
00:06:08,558 --> 00:06:10,699
- did that little story have a point?
- Yeah.

125
00:06:10,795 --> 00:06:13,063
The point is,
that even though Lily is my soul mate,

126
00:06:13,159 --> 00:06:15,203
long-distance still almost killed us.

127
00:06:15,299 --> 00:06:18,686
If you think that there's any chance
that Victoria's your soul mate,

128
00:06:18,782 --> 00:06:19,868
you should ask her to stay.

129
00:06:19,964 --> 00:06:22,968
Well, I don't know if she is.
It's still too early. But, yeah, she could be.

130
00:06:23,064 --> 00:06:25,715
Oh, please. You barely know this girl.
What's her favorite color?

131
00:06:25,811 --> 00:06:29,262
Is she a cat person, or a dog person?
Is she open to a three-way?

132
00:06:29,357 --> 00:06:32,073
Ted, I do more research than this
before buying a cell phone.

133
00:06:32,169 --> 00:06:35,424
And, FYI, yes, I have three-way calling.

134
00:06:36,254 --> 00:06:38,746
Look, she can't be a cat person.
I'm a dog person.

135
00:06:38,841 --> 00:06:40,567
I'm attracted to other dog people.

136
00:06:40,663 --> 00:06:42,860
- Are you sure?
- All right.

137
00:06:45,871 --> 00:06:47,532
- Hello?
- Hey, random question.

138
00:06:47,628 --> 00:06:52,452
- How do you feel about cats?
- Cats. Hated the musical, love the animal.

139
00:06:52,548 --> 00:06:54,827
Good to know. Okay, goodbye.

140
00:06:56,509 --> 00:07:00,497
She's a cat person.
I don't know this girl at all.

141
00:07:01,749 --> 00:07:03,730
- Oh, excellent. We'll take this one.
- This one.

142
00:07:03,826 --> 00:07:06,254
Hey, hey. It's my suit.
Shouldn't I be the one to choose?

143
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:10,264
Here, play with this pincushion.

144
00:07:16,126 --> 00:07:18,991
God, I'm gonna look hot.

145
00:07:19,673 --> 00:07:22,037
Marshall, I can't let you waste
a suit this nice...

146
00:07:22,132 --> 00:07:24,401
fighting a losing battle
for our planet's survival.

147
00:07:24,497 --> 00:07:27,979
This is a suit for winners.
I am getting you an interview at my office.

148
00:07:28,075 --> 00:07:29,833
We need good men like you
in our legal department.

149
00:07:29,929 --> 00:07:32,129
We get sued. A lot.

150
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:35,232
No way. The kid does not sell out.

151
00:07:35,328 --> 00:07:37,852
Oh, come on, dude.
Three months working with me,

152
00:07:37,948 --> 00:07:40,950
you'll make more than Lily makes in a year.

153
00:07:41,046 --> 00:07:43,162
No. I've made my decision.

154
00:07:43,570 --> 00:07:46,701
So have I. If I ask this girl
to give up her dreams for me,

155
00:07:46,797 --> 00:07:50,375
and, two weeks later, it's not working out,
I'm, like, the biggest jerk of all time.

156
00:07:50,471 --> 00:07:54,273
It's just too much pressure
on a new relationship.

157
00:07:54,369 --> 00:07:56,404
I'm gonna tell her to go.

158
00:07:57,404 --> 00:08:00,471
<i>And so, I met her that night
to tell her my decision.</i>

159
00:08:00,567 --> 00:08:02,772
All right, I've been thinking
a lot about this, and...

160
00:08:02,868 --> 00:08:05,455
Okay, wait. Before you say anything,

161
00:08:05,551 --> 00:08:08,132
I wanted to give you this.

162
00:08:09,353 --> 00:08:14,481
This is what happens when you,
you know, let them finish baking.

163
00:08:20,279 --> 00:08:22,194
I want you to stay.

164
00:08:25,993 --> 00:08:29,795
Everything here is dark and sketchy,
and seems illegal.

165
00:08:29,891 --> 00:08:31,999
It's like shopping in Barney's mind.

166
00:08:32,095 --> 00:08:34,048
- Good luck, baby.
- Bye.

167
00:08:34,588 --> 00:08:37,431
Now, what sort of dress
did you have in mind, dear?

168
00:08:37,527 --> 00:08:41,201
Nothing too huge or poofy.
I'm not really a girly girl.

169
00:08:41,297 --> 00:08:43,725
But I would like to look
like a beautiful princess.

170
00:08:43,821 --> 00:08:47,272
- I saw a couple up front that were nice.
- By the window?

171
00:08:47,367 --> 00:08:52,576
No offense, dear, but those are
a little out of your price range.

172
00:08:52,639 --> 00:08:53,948
Where does she get off?

173
00:08:54,044 --> 00:08:55,610
She doesn't know
how much money I make.

174
00:08:55,705 --> 00:08:57,016
These women are experts.

175
00:08:57,112 --> 00:09:00,499
They can guess your net annual income
just by looking at your underwear.

176
00:09:00,595 --> 00:09:04,556
Damn you, Old Navy
and your reasonably-priced three-packs.

177
00:09:04,652 --> 00:09:07,495
- Well, at least we get free champagne.
- And cake.

178
00:09:07,591 --> 00:09:09,061
Speaking of which, Victoria,

179
00:09:09,157 --> 00:09:12,543
have you decided what to do
about your donut fellowship?

180
00:09:12,639 --> 00:09:16,505
You know, I don't know. I mean,
I want to go, but I don't want to lose Ted.

181
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:19,284
I even thought about long-distance,
as if that ever works.

182
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:22,310
All talking and no sex. Kill me now.

183
00:09:22,767 --> 00:09:27,432
I know it sounds lame, but I actually think
that Ted might be the one.

184
00:09:27,527 --> 00:09:30,370
- That's pretty hard to walk away from.
- Well, I don't know.

185
00:09:30,466 --> 00:09:33,246
I'd feel a little Stepford
turning down a huge opportunity...

186
00:09:33,341 --> 00:09:35,418
to chase some guy
I'd only known two months.

187
00:09:35,514 --> 00:09:40,144
But this isn't just some guy. This is Ted.
He's amazing.

188
00:09:40,243 --> 00:09:44,843
- He's the best guy I know.
- Yeah, in America. But German guys?

189
00:09:44,939 --> 00:09:49,317
I would let them bread my schnitzel
any day, if you know what I mean.

190
00:09:49,412 --> 00:09:51,327
- I really don't.
- Sex.

191
00:09:52,671 --> 00:09:56,496
Excuse me, ma'am.
This bastard's kicked. Thanks.

192
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:01,265
That's okay, guys, I hate it.

193
00:10:01,361 --> 00:10:03,405
- Just horrible.
- It's bad. It's really bad.

194
00:10:03,501 --> 00:10:08,709
Short in the front, long in the back.
That is the mullet of wedding dresses.

195
00:10:08,805 --> 00:10:12,096
You know, Victoria,
Marshall and I did long-distance once.

196
00:10:12,192 --> 00:10:17,080
In college, I did an art course in Paris.
I was the only American there.

197
00:10:17,175 --> 00:10:21,138
I was really lonely.
I only had one friend. Gabrielle.

198
00:10:21,233 --> 00:10:23,598
And she was kind of homely
and strange-looking.

199
00:10:23,693 --> 00:10:27,367
And she was really self-conscious
about this little moustache she had.

200
00:10:27,463 --> 00:10:30,627
Anyway, halfway through the semester,
she just stopped talking to me,

201
00:10:30,722 --> 00:10:33,001
and I never figured out why.

202
00:10:33,566 --> 00:10:35,355
And then I had nobody.

203
00:10:35,451 --> 00:10:37,112
The only thing that got me through was...

204
00:10:37,208 --> 00:10:40,690
knowing that my soul mate
was back at home waiting for me.

205
00:10:40,786 --> 00:10:44,844
If Ted's your soul mate,
then it may be worth it to hang on to him.

206
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:48,071
But how am I supposed to know
if we're soul mates? It's too soon.

207
00:10:49,732 --> 00:10:50,690
Speak of the devil.

208
00:10:50,786 --> 00:10:52,416
- Hello?
- Hey, random question.

209
00:10:52,512 --> 00:10:56,026
- How do you feel about cats?
- Cats. Hated the musical, love the animal.

210
00:10:56,556 --> 00:11:00,544
- A cat person. Why am I not surprised?
- Stop it.

211
00:11:00,997 --> 00:11:04,161
Bye. Why does Ted want to know
if I like cats?

212
00:11:04,257 --> 00:11:06,334
Maybe he's gonna buy you one.

213
00:11:06,429 --> 00:11:08,602
I did hear barking in the background.

214
00:11:08,698 --> 00:11:12,084
Maybe he was in a pet store.
Does he want us to get a cat together?

215
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:16,301
Maybe he's using an adorable kitty
to guilt you into staying.

216
00:11:16,397 --> 00:11:19,624
That is low.
Do you really think that's what he's doing?

217
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:25,439
Oh, I wouldn't even wait to find out.
I would be on the next plane to Germany.

218
00:11:27,227 --> 00:11:29,113
Oh, God. You guys are sucky liars.

219
00:11:29,209 --> 00:11:32,659
- I don't know what to say.
- Ugly, ugly, ugly.

220
00:11:32,755 --> 00:11:35,151
You know what?
We're doing this all wrong.

221
00:11:35,247 --> 00:11:40,537
I'm gonna get you one of those
front-window dresses. Just for fun.

222
00:11:42,053 --> 00:11:44,169
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

223
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:48,858
Okay. Just kind of seems like you're trying
to hustle Victoria out of the country.

224
00:11:48,953 --> 00:11:51,062
I'm not. I'm just trying to support her.

225
00:11:51,158 --> 00:11:53,969
She got a super-important
dessert scholarship.

226
00:11:54,065 --> 00:11:55,375
Stop being sarcastic.

227
00:11:55,471 --> 00:11:58,123
It is a super-important dessert scholarship.

228
00:11:58,218 --> 00:12:01,541
Wow, that's hard to say
without sounding sarcastic.

229
00:12:01,637 --> 00:12:05,381
Look, I know you're not
Victoria's biggest fan,

230
00:12:05,535 --> 00:12:07,995
but she seems to make Ted happy.

231
00:12:08,090 --> 00:12:12,564
So think about that before you use
your miles to buy her a plane ticket.

232
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:14,385
Somebody say beautiful princess?

233
00:12:14,481 --> 00:12:16,932
Oh, my gosh. It's perfect.

234
00:12:17,036 --> 00:12:22,164
Oh, this dress is totally gonna get me laid
on my wedding night.

235
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:25,023
- Look how happy she is.
- Yeah.

236
00:12:25,439 --> 00:12:28,794
You know, I've always thought of myself
as one of those independent women...

237
00:12:28,889 --> 00:12:31,382
who would never let any guy
mess with my career,

238
00:12:31,478 --> 00:12:33,777
and now I'm actually thinking about it.

239
00:12:33,873 --> 00:12:37,861
I feel guilty.
Like it's un-feminist or something.

240
00:12:39,305 --> 00:12:41,910
- I know what you mean.
- You do?

241
00:12:43,235 --> 00:12:47,292
Well, I'm always putting my career
ahead of my relationships...

242
00:12:47,388 --> 00:12:52,021
and, to be honest, there's a lot
of lonely nights in that job description.

243
00:12:52,117 --> 00:12:54,225
See, that's what I'm afraid of.

244
00:12:54,321 --> 00:12:59,880
Well, then, choosing Ted over your career
doesn't make you un-feminist.

245
00:12:59,976 --> 00:13:04,353
Maybe it just means
that you guys would be happy together.

246
00:13:04,449 --> 00:13:09,143
Robin, I think that you are the coolest.

247
00:13:10,264 --> 00:13:12,149
I'm so glad that we're friends.

248
00:13:12,245 --> 00:13:15,759
- Oh, no way, you are the coolest.
- No. No, you are.

249
00:13:15,854 --> 00:13:17,769
Okay, I am.

250
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:23,425
I'm gonna stay.

251
00:13:31,446 --> 00:13:34,672
I am so beautiful.
Don't tell me how much it costs.

252
00:13:34,768 --> 00:13:37,868
Just snap my neck now
so I can die this pretty.

253
00:13:37,963 --> 00:13:39,998
Wow. You look incredible.

254
00:13:40,839 --> 00:13:44,800
Okay, okay. How much is it?
On a scale of never to never ever.

255
00:13:44,896 --> 00:13:48,477
Never ever, ever, ever, ever times infinity.

256
00:13:51,126 --> 00:13:53,041
Well, it's okay.

257
00:13:53,043 --> 00:13:55,631
You know, what makes a bride beautiful...

258
00:13:55,727 --> 00:13:59,471
is that she's just happy
to be getting married.

259
00:14:01,989 --> 00:14:04,385
Oh, guys, I know, I look amazing,

260
00:14:04,481 --> 00:14:08,506
but the important thing is
that Marshall and I love each other, right?

261
00:14:08,602 --> 00:14:10,517
Yes, you're right.

262
00:14:10,679 --> 00:14:14,016
But, also, you just sat down in the cake.

263
00:14:17,069 --> 00:14:21,766
But you know what? It's gonna come out,
because it's only chocolate and raspberry.

264
00:14:21,862 --> 00:14:24,800
Okay, come on. Get up.
Let us see how bad it is.

265
00:14:32,884 --> 00:14:38,825
- It was like this when I found it.
- And how will you be paying for this?

266
00:14:39,624 --> 00:14:41,539
Credit cards.

267
00:14:46,175 --> 00:14:48,821
I wanted to give you this.

268
00:14:49,913 --> 00:14:55,040
This is what happens when you,
you know, let them finish baking.

269
00:15:00,903 --> 00:15:02,818
I want you to stay.

270
00:15:05,919 --> 00:15:07,872
I have to go to Germany.

271
00:15:11,265 --> 00:15:14,227
- You're going?
- Yes. I have to.

272
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:16,856
- So that's what you decided?
- Well, no.

273
00:15:16,952 --> 00:15:19,348
I mean, I actually came here tonight
leaning towards staying,

274
00:15:19,444 --> 00:15:22,638
but when you just told me to stay,
it made me realize that I have to go.

275
00:15:22,734 --> 00:15:24,747
- What is this, opposite day or something?
- No.

276
00:15:24,842 --> 00:15:26,757
So it is?

277
00:15:27,559 --> 00:15:29,955
Ted, we've only been dating
for two months.

278
00:15:30,050 --> 00:15:32,319
I can't let you make this decision for me.

279
00:15:32,414 --> 00:15:35,227
I was totally gonna tell you to go,
but then you gave me this cupcake,

280
00:15:35,322 --> 00:15:36,984
and it reminded me how great you are.

281
00:15:37,079 --> 00:15:39,635
Well, is there any chance that
you would move to Germany with me?

282
00:15:39,731 --> 00:15:41,684
Well, that's just crazy.

283
00:15:42,351 --> 00:15:43,342
Okay.

284
00:15:43,437 --> 00:15:46,504
So it's fine for me to make sacrifices
for you, but for you, it's crazy.

285
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:48,741
But you have a job here and a life.
I'd have nothing there.

286
00:15:48,837 --> 00:15:53,069
- You'd have me.
- We've only been dating two months.

287
00:15:53,565 --> 00:15:55,993
It's not fair.
It's not fair that we have to break up.

288
00:15:56,089 --> 00:15:58,004
I hate this.

289
00:16:00,210 --> 00:16:02,726
So we're breaking up?

290
00:16:05,002 --> 00:16:06,917
I guess so.

291
00:16:09,732 --> 00:16:11,647
I guess so.

292
00:16:13,246 --> 00:16:14,859
God, that sucks, man. I'm so sorry.

293
00:16:14,955 --> 00:16:17,367
God, that sucks, man. I'm so sorry.

294
00:16:17,463 --> 00:16:22,223
It was just too much pressure too soon.
I mean, maybe it was silly to even think...

295
00:16:22,319 --> 00:16:25,099
Yes, Marshall, I see your new suit
and it's awesome.

296
00:16:25,194 --> 00:16:28,134
Well, thank you for acknowledging it.
It's weird that you hadn't.

297
00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:31,009
Look, I understand that you guys
had to break up eventually,

298
00:16:31,105 --> 00:16:32,958
- but why today?
- She's leaving tomorrow.

299
00:16:33,054 --> 00:16:34,652
Yeah, but she's still in town.

300
00:16:34,748 --> 00:16:37,080
- Yeah, she's still in town.
- Yeah.

301
00:16:37,176 --> 00:16:40,051
So you spend
one more amazing day together.

302
00:16:40,147 --> 00:16:41,584
Ted, think about it this way,

303
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:43,981
if you knew that you were gonna
lose your leg tomorrow,

304
00:16:44,077 --> 00:16:46,089
would you sit on the couch
and cry about it,

305
00:16:46,185 --> 00:16:48,294
or would you run and jump...

306
00:16:48,389 --> 00:16:52,540
and do some awesome air kicks
while you still could?

307
00:16:54,236 --> 00:16:56,151
Awesome air kicks, huh?

308
00:16:58,038 --> 00:17:00,887
- New pajama bottoms?
- You know it.

309
00:17:01,845 --> 00:17:03,219
So, we can sit around and cry,

310
00:17:03,314 --> 00:17:07,404
or we can run and do awesome air kicks
before our leg gets chopped off.

311
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:11,621
- Wait, so we're sharing the leg?
- No, the leg is a metaphor.

312
00:17:11,717 --> 00:17:14,784
How could the leg be well enough
to do awesome air kicks one day...

313
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:19,519
and yet still so sick
it needs to be chopped off the next?

314
00:17:19,704 --> 00:17:21,525
- I don't know, Ted.
- Come on.

315
00:17:21,621 --> 00:17:24,465
We've had a good run. Why end on a fight?

316
00:17:24,561 --> 00:17:25,935
Well, what would you want to do?

317
00:17:26,030 --> 00:17:27,372
Let's do all the stuff
we talked about doing...

318
00:17:27,468 --> 00:17:29,193
- and never got around to.
- Like go to the Met?

319
00:17:29,289 --> 00:17:30,790
Yeah, we'll walk across
the Brooklyn Bridge.

320
00:17:30,886 --> 00:17:32,516
See some monkeys at the zoo.

321
00:17:32,611 --> 00:17:34,976
Go to that French-Vietnamese place
we keep passing and say we want to try.

322
00:17:35,071 --> 00:17:37,838
- Wow. We better get going.
- Yeah.

323
00:17:38,458 --> 00:17:39,768
- Big day.
- Yeah.

324
00:17:39,864 --> 00:17:43,250
<i>And kids, that's exactly
what we did with our last day.</i>

325
00:17:43,346 --> 00:17:46,636
<i>The museum. The bridge. The restaurant.</i>

326
00:17:47,053 --> 00:17:49,413
<i>And all of those nice things.</i>

327
00:17:49,832 --> 00:17:52,612
Lily, you have to tell him.
That dress cost a fortune.

328
00:17:52,708 --> 00:17:55,775
No. I am just gonna wait for
the next time Marshall really screws up...

329
00:17:55,870 --> 00:17:59,161
and then I'll just slip this in,
and it won't seem so bad by comparison.

330
00:17:59,257 --> 00:18:05,198
- Well, here's hoping he cheats on you.
- Yeah, but only like second base.

331
00:18:05,583 --> 00:18:09,576
Look at us. Two guys in suits.
You feel that slight tingle?

332
00:18:09,672 --> 00:18:14,561
That's every girl in the bar wanting you,
and every guy wanting to be you.

333
00:18:14,657 --> 00:18:18,554
Actually, it's mostly me,
but you're getting some of the splash.

334
00:18:19,896 --> 00:18:24,593
Hey, babe. Dollar beer night.
So I splurged and got us each our own.

335
00:18:24,689 --> 00:18:27,628
So, have you thought any more
about coming to work for Barney Corp?

336
00:18:27,724 --> 00:18:30,215
Oh, please.
Your company is not called Barney Corp.

337
00:18:30,311 --> 00:18:32,101
Yet.

338
00:18:32,197 --> 00:18:35,615
I almost forgot. Sergei sent me your bill.

339
00:18:38,299 --> 00:18:40,088
Barney, this says $4,000.

340
00:18:40,184 --> 00:18:42,548
I thought you said
that it was one-third price!

341
00:18:42,644 --> 00:18:44,241
Must be a $12,000 dollar suit.

342
00:18:44,337 --> 00:18:47,149
Oh, well, guess you'll have
to come work at my company.

343
00:18:47,245 --> 00:18:50,088
You set this up.
You set this whole thing up.

344
00:18:50,183 --> 00:18:52,569
I most certainly did!

345
00:18:54,210 --> 00:18:55,838
Well, it won't work.

346
00:18:55,934 --> 00:18:59,098
Even if I have to get two extra night jobs,
I'll pay your precious tailor.

347
00:18:59,194 --> 00:19:01,147
I'm not selling my soul.

348
00:19:02,005 --> 00:19:03,922
Baby, I know that
this will make things harder,

349
00:19:04,018 --> 00:19:05,967
but I will make it work. I promise.

350
00:19:06,063 --> 00:19:08,993
I destroyed an $8,000 wedding dress.

351
00:19:10,791 --> 00:19:12,644
- What time is the interview?
- 9:00 a.m.

352
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:16,972
And you'll need new shoes. Don't worry.
I know a guy.

353
00:19:19,864 --> 00:19:22,548
Well, I'm glad we got to spend the day
doing awesome air kicks.

354
00:19:22,644 --> 00:19:26,307
Yeah. I was almost too tired for all the sex.

355
00:19:29,225 --> 00:19:33,701
- I'm gonna miss you so much.
- I'm gonna miss you, too.

356
00:19:39,321 --> 00:19:43,635
Hey, you know. I mean, if when I get back,
we're still single we can...

357
00:19:43,730 --> 00:19:45,645
Even if we're not.

358
00:19:47,181 --> 00:19:49,096
Okay.

359
00:20:04,944 --> 00:20:08,842
Look, I know it never works for anyone,
but do you wanna try long-distance?

360
00:20:08,938 --> 00:20:10,853
Yes. Yes.

361
00:20:14,273 --> 00:20:16,510
- We can beat the odds.
- Odds, schmodds.

362
00:20:16,606 --> 00:20:20,919
It's gonna work.
We're gonna make it work. It'll work.

363
00:20:21,558 --> 00:20:22,932
<i>It didn't work.</i>

364
00:20:23,028 --> 00:20:26,365
<i>Long-distance was and is a terrible idea.</i>

365
00:20:26,446 --> 00:20:29,703
<i>A really terrible idea. Just awful.</i>

366
00:20:30,536 --> 00:20:32,451
<i>But more on that later.</i>
