00:00:12,941 --> 00:00:16,322
So, kids, there are
many buildings in New York City.

3
00:00:16,417 --> 00:00:19,992
<i>Thousands of apartments.
Millions of stories.</i>

4
00:00:20,403 --> 00:00:23,816
<i>And even though it's been decades,
and someone else lives there now,</i>

5
00:00:23,911 --> 00:00:29,014
<i>there's one apartment in particular,
that will always be our apartment.</i>

6
00:00:29,110 --> 00:00:31,534
<i>I have so many great memories
of that place.</i>

7
00:00:31,629 --> 00:00:33,985
<i>Marshall playing video games.</i>

8
00:00:34,052 --> 00:00:36,733
<i>Lily painting on the fire escape.</i>

9
00:00:37,146 --> 00:00:40,103
- Hey!
- Sorry, Mr. Matson!

10
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:44,225
<i>And me making the coffee.
I had this coffee pot.</i>

11
00:00:44,321 --> 00:00:48,627
<i>It was probably 50 years old at that time,
and it made truly terrible coffee.</i>

12
00:00:48,722 --> 00:00:50,634
<i>We called it Shocky.</i>

13
00:00:50,731 --> 00:00:53,006
- Plugging in.
- Saving game.

14
00:00:57,269 --> 00:00:59,374
<i>I loved every last detail of that place,</i>

15
00:00:59,470 --> 00:01:02,722
<i>right down to the incredibly tacky swords
we hung on the wall.</i>

16
00:01:02,818 --> 00:01:08,098
<i>I never wanted any of it to change,
but that's not how life works.</i>

17
00:01:08,941 --> 00:01:11,333
You guys will never believe
what just happened to us.

18
00:01:11,428 --> 00:01:12,959
I don't even believe it myself.

19
00:01:13,055 --> 00:01:16,180
We were in Queens
and we decided to stop by my apartment.

20
00:01:16,643 --> 00:01:18,046
Wait, her apartment?

21
00:01:18,141 --> 00:01:20,342
I thought Aunt Lily lived with you
and Uncle Marshall.

22
00:01:20,437 --> 00:01:24,233
I could see how you would think that,
but I have to have my own place.

23
00:01:24,328 --> 00:01:25,764
It's an independence thing.

24
00:01:25,859 --> 00:01:29,526
- When was the last time you were there?
- Three months ago.

25
00:01:29,622 --> 00:01:32,003
What? It's like fat pants.

26
00:01:32,110 --> 00:01:37,818
You hope you never have to use them,
but you're glad to know they're there.

27
00:01:37,913 --> 00:01:39,825
- What the hell?
- What?

28
00:01:40,816 --> 00:01:42,727
This is my apartment.

29
00:01:42,856 --> 00:01:44,954
- Where?
- Right here!

30
00:01:46,971 --> 00:01:48,883
What the hell?

31
00:01:49,076 --> 00:01:50,798
Lily, this is a Chinese restaurant.

32
00:01:50,893 --> 00:01:53,851
No! No! This was my apartment!

33
00:01:54,370 --> 00:01:57,782
My dresser was right... That's my dresser!

34
00:01:58,292 --> 00:02:00,739
And this is my closet.

35
00:02:01,258 --> 00:02:05,320
And I spilled nail polish there.
There's the stain!

36
00:02:05,627 --> 00:02:07,538
Hi, how many?

37
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:10,117
- Lily!
- Yes. You know me?

38
00:02:10,219 --> 00:02:15,906
Yeah, from your homecoming picture.
You're much prettier in the person.

39
00:02:15,927 --> 00:02:18,543
Yeah, I know, the bangs were a mistake.

40
00:02:18,638 --> 00:02:19,913
Where is my stuff?

41
00:02:20,009 --> 00:02:23,007
It's all in the back.
We could wrap it up for you.

42
00:02:23,103 --> 00:02:24,857
You want it to go?

43
00:02:24,952 --> 00:02:28,486
- This is my apartment.
- Not anymore.

44
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:31,522
No way. You're making this up.

45
00:02:31,618 --> 00:02:33,913
Yeah, the building would've had
to give you some kind of notice.

46
00:02:34,009 --> 00:02:35,604
They sent you a notice about this.

47
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:37,928
- When?
- Three month ago.

48
00:02:38,028 --> 00:02:41,115
And here's your mail. Minus magazines.

49
00:02:41,791 --> 00:02:45,426
Well, still, legally they can't just toss you
out on the street, you have a lease.

50
00:02:45,522 --> 00:02:48,360
Okay, so I didn't have
a written lease as such.

51
00:02:48,455 --> 00:02:51,478
But go ask my landlady, Mrs. Conroy.

52
00:02:51,709 --> 00:02:55,039
She may be 98 years old, but she still...

53
00:02:55,471 --> 00:02:56,811
She's dead, isn't she?

54
00:02:56,907 --> 00:02:58,819
Never even saw the bus.

55
00:02:59,904 --> 00:03:03,188
My apartment is a Chinese restaurant.

56
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:06,921
- What am I gonna do?
- Come live with us.

57
00:03:07,016 --> 00:03:08,928
- Really?
- Of course.

58
00:03:09,025 --> 00:03:10,779
- You sure about this, Ted?
- Yeah.

59
00:03:10,875 --> 00:03:14,288
I mean, you basically live here anyway.
It's not like it'll change anything.

60
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:17,261
No, it's like it'll change everything!

61
00:03:17,357 --> 00:03:19,632
Oh, Ted! You are so screwed.

62
00:03:19,685 --> 00:03:23,672
- What are you talking about?
- And why is that girl checking you out?

63
00:03:23,767 --> 00:03:25,679
Because I look good.

64
00:03:26,032 --> 00:03:28,678
Now focus.
You and Marshall are roommates.

65
00:03:28,774 --> 00:03:31,708
You have an amazing apartment.
Marshall and Lily just got engaged.

66
00:03:31,803 --> 00:03:32,888
Yeah. So?

67
00:03:32,984 --> 00:03:35,949
So, you're not still gonna be his roommate
when he gets married, are you?

68
00:03:36,045 --> 00:03:38,087
Someone's going to move out.
So, who's it going to be?

69
00:03:38,182 --> 00:03:40,829
Come on, Barney, I'm sure they've talked
about who gets the apartment.

70
00:03:40,924 --> 00:03:42,455
You've talked about
who gets the apartment, right?

71
00:03:42,551 --> 00:03:44,464
Yeah, we've talked about it.

72
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:47,268
So, when Lily and I get married,

73
00:03:48,291 --> 00:03:52,597
- who's gonna get the apartment?
- That's a tough one.

74
00:03:53,075 --> 00:03:55,721
You know who I think
could handle a problem like that?

75
00:03:55,817 --> 00:03:59,285
- Who?
- Future Ted and Future Marshall.

76
00:04:00,888 --> 00:04:03,950
Totally. Let's let those guys handle it.

77
00:04:04,045 --> 00:04:05,957
Damn it, Past Ted!

78
00:04:06,788 --> 00:04:08,254
You blew it, dude.

79
00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:10,360
Now that Lily's there,
it's a whole new dynamic.

80
00:04:10,455 --> 00:04:12,369
- They're edging you out.
- That's crazy.

81
00:04:12,464 --> 00:04:15,366
They're not edging me out.
Marshall's my best friend.

82
00:04:15,462 --> 00:04:17,397
One of my best friends.

83
00:04:17,885 --> 00:04:19,998
He wouldn't do that to me.

84
00:04:20,086 --> 00:04:22,478
Just keep your eyes open.
That's all I'm saying, Teddy.

85
00:04:22,573 --> 00:04:25,221
Little things are gonna be changing
around that apartment.

86
00:04:25,317 --> 00:04:27,038
Come on, Barney,
you're just being paranoid.

87
00:04:27,133 --> 00:04:30,546
Okay, seriously, what is this girl's deal?

88
00:04:31,057 --> 00:04:33,002
- Sort of on a date with her.
- What?

89
00:04:33,097 --> 00:04:36,022
Yeah, yeah. I found her online.

90
00:04:36,127 --> 00:04:39,699
I'm tired of the whole bar scene,
the one-night hookups.

91
00:04:39,794 --> 00:04:41,772
I'm looking for a soul mate.

92
00:04:41,867 --> 00:04:44,630
Someone who I can love and cuddle.

93
00:04:44,642 --> 00:04:46,998
Or, so it says in my profile.

94
00:04:49,681 --> 00:04:55,161
But this girl, she wants the same stuff,
and it's bumming me out.

95
00:04:55,293 --> 00:04:57,047
All right, Ted, call me from the hospital.

96
00:04:57,142 --> 00:04:58,674
- All right.
- You're going to the hospital?

97
00:04:58,769 --> 00:05:00,778
No, see, he's gonna go back over there.
I'm gonna call him.

98
00:05:00,874 --> 00:05:02,086
He's gonna pretend it's an emergency call...

99
00:05:02,181 --> 00:05:03,617
from a family member at the hospital.

100
00:05:03,712 --> 00:05:05,817
Oh, Lord! The fake emergency?

101
00:05:05,913 --> 00:05:09,133
That is the lamest,
most pathetic cop-out in the book.

102
00:05:09,229 --> 00:05:10,473
I expect more from you, Barney.

103
00:05:10,569 --> 00:05:13,152
Well, stay tuned.
I'm working on some stuff.

104
00:05:13,248 --> 00:05:16,010
But in the meantime, wish me luck.

105
00:05:17,362 --> 00:05:19,657
So, are you gonna talk to Marshall?

106
00:05:19,753 --> 00:05:22,114
He's gonna want the apartment.
I'm gonna want the apartment.

107
00:05:22,209 --> 00:05:26,227
- It's gonna lead to an argument. So, no.
- That's real healthy.

108
00:05:26,323 --> 00:05:30,979
So, when a serious issue comes up,
your response is just to avoid it?

109
00:05:31,075 --> 00:05:33,593
I should really make this call.

110
00:05:33,657 --> 00:05:35,569
Oh, can I do it?

111
00:05:39,748 --> 00:05:41,660
Excuse me.

112
00:05:42,268 --> 00:05:44,649
- Hello.
- Hi there, sexy.

113
00:05:45,330 --> 00:05:48,986
- Hello, Aunt Kathy. What's up?
- Oh, nothing.

114
00:05:49,188 --> 00:05:53,088
Just sitting here,
thinking about you, hot stuff.

115
00:05:53,111 --> 00:05:54,865
An accident?

116
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:57,722
Well, is Uncle Rudy gonna be okay?

117
00:05:57,895 --> 00:06:02,688
Aunt Kathy's got an itch
that only you can scratch, big boy.

118
00:06:03,858 --> 00:06:05,133
Oh, God!

119
00:06:05,229 --> 00:06:08,547
Why did he think
he could build his own helicopter?

120
00:06:09,144 --> 00:06:10,323
Come on, Daddy.

121
00:06:10,419 --> 00:06:13,994
Break me off a piece
of that white chocolate.

122
00:06:14,756 --> 00:06:17,659
Well, if he needs a transplant,
he can have mine.

123
00:06:17,755 --> 00:06:19,540
I'll be right there.

124
00:06:19,635 --> 00:06:21,547
You know, I...

125
00:06:25,185 --> 00:06:27,096
See you guys later.

126
00:06:27,417 --> 00:06:29,611
Put it on my tab.

127
00:06:31,244 --> 00:06:35,144
This'll be nice.
The three of us living together.

128
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:38,012
I think it's a good setup.

129
00:06:38,770 --> 00:06:40,801
Man, this coffee's great.

130
00:06:42,214 --> 00:06:44,126
It's really great.

131
00:06:46,424 --> 00:06:48,335
Too great.

132
00:06:50,825 --> 00:06:52,775
What happened to Shocky?

133
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:02,178
- What's this?
- My coffee maker. From my apartment.

134
00:07:02,274 --> 00:07:05,590
- Makes great coffee, right?
- Yeah, definitely.

135
00:07:05,686 --> 00:07:07,597
I mean, so does Shocky.

136
00:07:07,631 --> 00:07:11,617
Really? I always thought Shocky's coffee
tasted kind of rusty.

137
00:07:11,713 --> 00:07:13,308
Yeah. No. It did.

138
00:07:13,404 --> 00:07:16,572
I mean, I kind of like the rusty taste.

139
00:07:16,784 --> 00:07:19,140
I'm used to it. I don't know.

140
00:07:19,144 --> 00:07:23,775
Also, Lily's coffee maker doesn't,
you know, shock people.

141
00:07:24,247 --> 00:07:26,989
No, it's just...
You gotta admit that shock, that...

142
00:07:27,084 --> 00:07:29,093
Wakes you up in the morning.

143
00:07:29,189 --> 00:07:31,166
You know what else wakes you up
in the morning?

144
00:07:31,262 --> 00:07:33,174
Coffee.

145
00:07:33,845 --> 00:07:36,039
That's great. You're right.

146
00:07:36,875 --> 00:07:39,452
Roomies! I love it.

147
00:07:40,829 --> 00:07:43,477
They're edging me out.
They're totally edging me out.

148
00:07:43,572 --> 00:07:47,016
- I didn't believe it, but you're right.
- Told you. That Lily, she's a shrewd one.

149
00:07:47,111 --> 00:07:49,823
Yeah. She got you a nice new coffee maker.

150
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:53,818
- How dare she?
- It's not just the coffee maker.

151
00:07:54,032 --> 00:07:56,144
Done. The painting's done.

152
00:07:57,349 --> 00:07:59,284
- That is great.
- Nice.

153
00:07:59,996 --> 00:08:03,571
- Where do you wanna hang it?
- I don't know.

154
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:06,021
Over the piano?

155
00:08:06,469 --> 00:08:08,734
Yeah, that would be a good place for it.

156
00:08:08,829 --> 00:08:13,541
Too bad the swords are there.
We kind of love those swords.

157
00:08:14,059 --> 00:08:16,323
Well, those swords have been up there
a long time.

158
00:08:16,419 --> 00:08:19,417
I know, right. I'd really miss them, too.

159
00:08:19,513 --> 00:08:21,544
So maybe Marshall's room.

160
00:08:22,734 --> 00:08:24,645
Okay.

161
00:08:25,093 --> 00:08:27,836
He was gonna take the swords down!
Can you believe that?

162
00:08:27,932 --> 00:08:30,515
Ted, why don't you just talk to him?
He's your best friend.

163
00:08:30,611 --> 00:08:32,523
That is I think.

164
00:08:33,130 --> 00:08:35,161
One of your best friends.

165
00:08:35,809 --> 00:08:38,583
The point is, maybe it's time
for some healthy communication.

166
00:08:38,679 --> 00:08:42,155
Healthy communication?
That's the worst idea ever!

167
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:44,387
Look, you held off their first advance.
That's good.

168
00:08:44,483 --> 00:08:48,023
- Now, it's time to counterstrike.
- Yeah, well, what am I supposed to do?

169
00:08:48,119 --> 00:08:52,265
You gotta mark your territory.
And I don't mean missing the toilet.

170
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:54,241
You gotta do something big.

171
00:08:54,337 --> 00:08:57,587
- What, like, buy a new sofa?
- Bigger.

172
00:08:58,387 --> 00:09:01,449
Katie's here. Okay, real quick.
Last night, epiphany.

173
00:09:01,544 --> 00:09:03,203
I realized what the world of dating needs.

174
00:09:03,298 --> 00:09:05,559
Ready? A lemon law.

175
00:09:05,659 --> 00:09:08,827
- A lemon law, like for cars.
- Exactly.

176
00:09:08,911 --> 00:09:11,622
From the moment the date begins,
you have five minutes to decide...

177
00:09:11,717 --> 00:09:13,631
whether you're going
to commit to an entire evening.

178
00:09:13,726 --> 00:09:16,246
And, if you don't, it's no hard feelings,
just, 'Good night.

179
00:09:16,341 --> 00:09:19,266
'Thanks for playing. See you never.'

180
00:09:19,499 --> 00:09:21,955
The lemon law. It's gonna be a thing.

181
00:09:22,050 --> 00:09:24,325
Possibly starting right now.

182
00:09:26,259 --> 00:09:30,848
- Hi, Katie. Barney.
- Hi! It's good to finally meet you.

183
00:09:34,902 --> 00:09:38,964
Yeah. Katie, you are about to be
a part of history.

184
00:09:45,535 --> 00:09:47,447
Tell your friends.

185
00:09:48,246 --> 00:09:50,157
It's gonna be a thing.

186
00:09:50,989 --> 00:09:54,847
Man, Ted's been acting weird.
He's started labeling all his food.

187
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:57,782
He even carved 'Ted'
into that block of cheese.

188
00:09:57,877 --> 00:10:00,236
Yeah. Well, now it's Ed's.

189
00:10:02,246 --> 00:10:06,456
- I think he's not cool with me moving in.
- No, that's not it.

190
00:10:06,552 --> 00:10:09,549
I mean, you basically lived here all along.
Ted loves you.

191
00:10:09,645 --> 00:10:13,406
- So, what's he PMS-ing about?
- I don't know.

192
00:10:13,504 --> 00:10:16,565
But when he's ready to talk to me about it,
he'll come and talk to me about it.

193
00:10:16,661 --> 00:10:19,786
Are you kidding?
You guys never talk about anything.

194
00:10:19,882 --> 00:10:22,019
He'll just let it fester under the surface...

195
00:10:22,114 --> 00:10:24,697
until he does something big
and passive-aggressive.

196
00:10:24,792 --> 00:10:26,986
You clearly don't know Ted.

197
00:10:27,663 --> 00:10:29,574
Delivery for Ted Mosby.

198
00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:36,943
Your English phone booth arrived!

199
00:10:37,039 --> 00:10:40,224
Oh, awesome! It's great, right?

200
00:10:40,324 --> 00:10:44,873
Yeah, I guess.
I'm just not sure if Lily's gonna like it.

201
00:10:45,458 --> 00:10:47,116
Well, I like it.

202
00:10:47,212 --> 00:10:51,517
So, I'm just gonna keep it right here,
if that's cool.

203
00:10:52,155 --> 00:10:54,355
Of course. I mean, we all live here,

204
00:10:54,451 --> 00:10:57,544
so we should all be able to have things
the way we want them.

205
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:58,788
Exactly.

206
00:10:58,883 --> 00:11:00,795
Great. Terrific.

207
00:11:00,989 --> 00:11:03,412
You like the phone booth. It stays.

208
00:11:03,507 --> 00:11:05,475
I like this painting.

209
00:11:05,581 --> 00:11:10,169
So, I'm just gonna hang it
right here on the wall.

210
00:11:16,743 --> 00:11:18,752
Oh, so it's like that, is it?

211
00:11:21,877 --> 00:11:24,874
Oh, hello, governor.
Oh, it's like that, innit? Cheerio.

212
00:11:24,970 --> 00:11:26,905
Yeah, it's like that.

213
00:11:28,246 --> 00:11:32,064
- I want this apartment!
- Well, I want it, too.

214
00:11:32,105 --> 00:11:33,253
You're a jerk!

215
00:11:33,349 --> 00:11:37,654
No, I'm a visionary. Lemon law!
It's gonna be a thing!

216
00:11:40,046 --> 00:11:43,522
For the record, your little lemon law
is a symbol of everything that's wrong...

217
00:11:43,617 --> 00:11:45,563
with our no-attention-span society.

218
00:11:45,659 --> 00:11:48,177
No, wrong, lemon law's awesome.

219
00:11:48,274 --> 00:11:51,495
It takes longer than five minutes
to really get to know someone.

220
00:11:51,590 --> 00:11:55,194
You keep giving up on people so quickly,
you could miss out on something great.

221
00:11:55,289 --> 00:11:57,645
Okay, you're on a blind date.

222
00:11:57,681 --> 00:12:00,687
Sitting across the table is that guy.

223
00:12:01,125 --> 00:12:03,581
You really think it'll take
more than five minutes...

224
00:12:03,677 --> 00:12:06,196
to realize there will be no date number two?

225
00:12:06,292 --> 00:12:07,568
Yes, I do.

226
00:12:07,663 --> 00:12:10,913
For all I know, that guy's my soul mate.

227
00:12:12,128 --> 00:12:14,039
Bad move Scherbatsky.

228
00:12:15,062 --> 00:12:17,606
Hi. Have you met Robin?

229
00:12:19,303 --> 00:12:21,214
- Hi.
- Hi.

230
00:12:23,188 --> 00:12:24,240
All right, Marshall.

231
00:12:24,263 --> 00:12:26,973
We're deciding right now
who gets this apartment.

232
00:12:26,974 --> 00:12:30,873
May lead to an argument,
but we're settling this.

233
00:12:31,055 --> 00:12:35,280
- Or we could flip a coin.
- Yeah, let's flip a coin.

234
00:12:35,648 --> 00:12:38,008
- Flip it.
- Okay. I'm flipping it. Here I go.

235
00:12:38,103 --> 00:12:39,666
- Flip it.
- Okay, here I go. I'll flip it.

236
00:12:39,761 --> 00:12:41,037
- Flip it. Go ahead.
- I'm flipping!

237
00:12:41,133 --> 00:12:43,044
Flip it.

238
00:12:43,142 --> 00:12:44,705
But before I do,
I just want to say something.

239
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,650
You didn't even wanna move in here
in the first place.

240
00:12:46,745 --> 00:12:48,467
You said a prewar building
was bad for your allergies.

241
00:12:48,563 --> 00:12:49,520
That was five years ago.

242
00:12:49,615 --> 00:12:51,879
Now you can get prescription-level
antihistamines over the counter.

243
00:12:51,975 --> 00:12:54,250
Oh, snap. What else you got?

244
00:12:54,909 --> 00:12:57,429
Okay, I'm flipping. Heads or tails?

245
00:12:57,524 --> 00:12:59,788
- You don't need two rooms.
- Heads or tails, Marshall?

246
00:12:59,884 --> 00:13:02,595
- Like you need two rooms.
- We might be starting a family soon.

247
00:13:02,691 --> 00:13:03,615
Oh, no, you're not!

248
00:13:03,711 --> 00:13:05,816
There's no way you're having a baby
while you're still in law school.

249
00:13:05,912 --> 00:13:07,730
- It's gonna be at least three years.
- It could be sooner.

250
00:13:07,825 --> 00:13:10,345
We're not that careful
with our birth control! Two, zip.

251
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:13,406
Oh, come on! You know damn well,
I move out, that room's going unused.

252
00:13:13,502 --> 00:13:14,905
Oh, and I suppose
you'll get a new roommate?

253
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,509
Who's it gonna be? Barney?
You know, he cooks naked.

254
00:13:18,604 --> 00:13:21,570
Yeah, well, at least Barney
wouldn't take the swords down.

255
00:13:21,666 --> 00:13:24,855
We were bros!
These swords represent our bro-hood.

256
00:13:24,951 --> 00:13:27,566
And you took them down to make room
for your fiancée's stupid painting?

257
00:13:27,661 --> 00:13:30,754
My fiancée? Suddenly, she's 'my fiancée'?

258
00:13:30,850 --> 00:13:32,221
Lily's a part of who I am.

259
00:13:32,317 --> 00:13:34,964
And if you're such a bro,
she's a part of who you are, too.

260
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:37,091
She's a bro by extension.

261
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:39,748
I deserve this apartment, Marshall.

262
00:13:39,843 --> 00:13:41,755
No more than I do.

263
00:13:42,522 --> 00:13:44,878
Great. So, let's flip for it.

264
00:13:46,094 --> 00:13:48,006
Flip it.

265
00:13:53,387 --> 00:13:55,716
So, is this how we're deciding
who gets the apartment?

266
00:13:55,811 --> 00:13:57,597
I guess so.

267
00:13:57,692 --> 00:14:00,340
How we doing this exactly?
Is this like, to the death?

268
00:14:00,435 --> 00:14:03,279
We should probably figure that out.

269
00:14:03,496 --> 00:14:06,096
He's okay. He's okay. He's okay.

270
00:14:06,398 --> 00:14:09,556
- Can I observe something?
- That this is kind of awesome?

271
00:14:09,652 --> 00:14:10,608
Totally.

272
00:14:10,704 --> 00:14:13,829
- I can't believe we didn't do this before.
- I know.

273
00:14:15,583 --> 00:14:17,495
Thank you.

274
00:14:18,389 --> 00:14:19,634
I can't believe this.

275
00:14:19,729 --> 00:14:21,961
I'm sitting here
with a beautiful woman I just met,

276
00:14:22,056 --> 00:14:25,306
eating at my favorite restaurant. Sweet.

277
00:14:26,267 --> 00:14:27,925
Well, it's a nice place.

278
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:30,349
It's good to know the future has ribs.

279
00:14:30,444 --> 00:14:34,398
In the future, food will most likely
be served in gel-cap form.

280
00:14:34,494 --> 00:14:37,779
Plus, cows will probably have
died out by then.

281
00:14:37,874 --> 00:14:39,786
Or be our leaders.

282
00:14:41,350 --> 00:14:44,243
Just one second. Hello?

283
00:14:45,432 --> 00:14:48,111
Time's running out, Scherbatsky.
Last chance for the lemon law.

284
00:14:48,207 --> 00:14:49,323
Leave me alone.

285
00:14:49,419 --> 00:14:51,810
Four fifty-six. Four fifty-seven.
Four fifty-eight.

286
00:14:51,906 --> 00:14:53,852
We're only just getting to know each other.

287
00:14:53,947 --> 00:14:58,540
Say I'm right and this could all be over.
This could be your call from the hospital.

288
00:14:58,635 --> 00:14:59,879
Sorry.

289
00:14:59,974 --> 00:15:01,186
Let me guess.

290
00:15:01,282 --> 00:15:03,929
There's been a crazy accident
and you have to go.

291
00:15:04,025 --> 00:15:09,468
No! I would never do that.
I don't wanna go anywhere. I'm all yours.

292
00:15:09,988 --> 00:15:14,294
Look, if you're a hooker,
I don't have a lot of money.

293
00:15:16,845 --> 00:15:18,184
- Oh, that was awesome.
- I know.

294
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:19,459
Do it again.

295
00:15:19,555 --> 00:15:21,852
Okay, but this time,
jump up and I'll swipe your legs.

296
00:15:21,947 --> 00:15:22,968
Oh, yeah.

297
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:32,726
Look. Here's why I should get the place.

298
00:15:32,822 --> 00:15:34,831
You and Lily. You get to be married.

299
00:15:34,927 --> 00:15:39,137
What do I get, right? I get to be unmarried,
alone, minus two roommates,

300
00:15:39,232 --> 00:15:41,879
and, on top of that, I have to be homeless!
Does that seem fair?

301
00:15:41,974 --> 00:15:44,412
- Oh, boo-freaking-hoo.
- What?

302
00:15:44,909 --> 00:15:48,321
Woe is me! I'm not married yet!
My ovaries are shrinking!

303
00:15:48,416 --> 00:15:51,765
Ted! If you wanted to be married by now,
you would be, but you're not.

304
00:15:51,861 --> 00:15:54,412
And you know why?
Because you're irrationally picky,

305
00:15:54,507 --> 00:15:57,473
you're easily distracted,
and you're utterly anhedonic.

306
00:15:57,980 --> 00:15:59,351
- 'Anhedonic'?
- Anhedonic.

307
00:15:59,447 --> 00:16:02,923
- It means you can't enjoy anything.
- The hell I can't. I'm enjoying this.

308
00:16:03,018 --> 00:16:04,930
I know. This rules!

309
00:16:08,791 --> 00:16:11,948
- Hey, I'm sorry I took the swords down.
- Dude, that's okay!

310
00:16:12,044 --> 00:16:14,085
It led to this totally rad sword fight,
didn't it?

311
00:16:14,181 --> 00:16:16,092
Yeah, it did.

312
00:16:18,932 --> 00:16:20,527
You remember
when we first got these swords?

313
00:16:20,623 --> 00:16:22,504
It was the day we moved in.

314
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:23,652
Congratulations, Marshall.

315
00:16:23,748 --> 00:16:25,917
We live in an apartment
with swords on the wall.

316
00:16:26,012 --> 00:16:29,042
List of life-long dreams,
you're now half as long.

317
00:16:29,137 --> 00:16:31,624
Crap. I'm missing one of those screws
for this table.

318
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:35,132
Well, just use this wood glue. It'll hold.

319
00:16:35,356 --> 00:16:36,663
Yeah!

320
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:45,228
Oh, God! I'll be right there.

321
00:16:45,324 --> 00:16:50,043
Kevin, I'm so sorry. I have to go.
My friend's been stabbed with a sword.

322
00:16:53,583 --> 00:16:56,346
Klingon insult. You have no honor.

323
00:16:56,358 --> 00:16:58,845
You know, if you felt this way,
you could have just been up front.

324
00:16:58,941 --> 00:17:01,843
No, I swear that was a real call. I just...

325
00:17:01,939 --> 00:17:03,850
Oh, forget it.

326
00:17:06,563 --> 00:17:10,890
I stabbed Lily. I stabbed my fiancée.

327
00:17:12,048 --> 00:17:17,166
Come on, Marshall.
Do you really think she's still your fiancée?

328
00:17:17,215 --> 00:17:19,126
I'm kidding.

329
00:17:19,415 --> 00:17:22,795
Hey, I think you guys
should have the apartment.

330
00:17:22,891 --> 00:17:25,251
But you fought so bravely for it.

331
00:17:25,346 --> 00:17:28,695
I wasn't fighting for the apartment.
I was fighting for...

332
00:17:28,791 --> 00:17:32,853
I don't know.
For everything to stay the way it is.

333
00:17:32,873 --> 00:17:34,913
But I'm not gonna get that, so...

334
00:17:35,009 --> 00:17:37,464
Seriously, take the place. It's yours.

335
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:38,868
Is she okay?

336
00:17:38,964 --> 00:17:40,813
Well, they're just patching her up.
She's gonna be fine.

337
00:17:40,909 --> 00:17:44,736
So, get this.
I was on a date with this girl Jackie.

338
00:17:45,382 --> 00:17:49,305
What? You said she's fine. So, anyway,
I was on a date with this girl Jackie.

339
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:52,430
Wow, Jackie.
You make a really great first impression.

340
00:17:52,526 --> 00:17:57,806
I have a feeling that tonight
you might end up being Jackie... oh.

341
00:17:59,638 --> 00:18:03,537
Yeah, I'm sorry.
I'm gonna have to lemon-law you.

342
00:18:04,581 --> 00:18:08,280
It's out there. It's a thing!
The lemon law is a thing!

343
00:18:08,375 --> 00:18:10,257
Damn. I should've called it Barney's law.

344
00:18:10,353 --> 00:18:14,740
- But, you totally got...
- Just let him have this one.

345
00:18:14,881 --> 00:18:15,902
All set.

346
00:18:15,997 --> 00:18:21,770
She said she'd like to see the knights
of the poorly-constructed round table.

347
00:18:21,866 --> 00:18:23,777
That's us.

348
00:18:24,990 --> 00:18:26,902
A sword fight?

349
00:18:27,254 --> 00:18:29,327
- Sorry, Lily.
- Sorry, Lily.

350
00:18:29,423 --> 00:18:32,262
On Monday, I'm gonna have to tell
my kindergarten class,

351
00:18:32,357 --> 00:18:34,558
who I teach not to run with scissors,

352
00:18:34,654 --> 00:18:39,203
that my fiancé ran me through
with a fricking broadsword!

353
00:18:39,245 --> 00:18:42,850
Well, just to be fair,
it didn't go all the way through.

354
00:18:42,945 --> 00:18:48,551
I'm sorry. Is this a discussion of the degree
to which you stabbed me?

355
00:18:48,908 --> 00:18:51,072
You're right. I'm sorry.

356
00:18:51,811 --> 00:18:55,542
We were fighting to see
who gets the apartment. And I won.

357
00:18:55,638 --> 00:18:58,345
You didn't win. I gave it to you.

358
00:18:58,444 --> 00:19:00,390
- You know what, if I had tried...
- Okay, wait, wait, wait!

359
00:19:00,485 --> 00:19:03,866
I don't want that apartment!
It's a boy apartment.

360
00:19:03,961 --> 00:19:09,659
It's full of swords and video games
and kind of smells like dude.

361
00:19:12,539 --> 00:19:15,920
I mean, it's fine for now,
but when we get married,

362
00:19:16,015 --> 00:19:18,535
I wanna start a new life with you.

363
00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:20,542
In a new place.

364
00:19:21,756 --> 00:19:25,127
- Gonna miss the old place.
- I will, too.

365
00:19:26,412 --> 00:19:28,517
We're not getting married for, like, a year.

366
00:19:28,612 --> 00:19:30,526
Yeah, that's Future Marshall's problem.

367
00:19:30,621 --> 00:19:33,709
- Let that guy deal with it.
- Totally.

368
00:19:33,811 --> 00:19:37,924
Maybe it's the massive blood loss talking,
but I'm starving.

369
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:42,163
- Let's go get some dinner.
- I know just the place.

370
00:19:42,804 --> 00:19:44,048
A Chinese restaurant.

371
00:19:44,144 --> 00:19:46,726
- I still don't believe it.
- I told you.

372
00:19:46,822 --> 00:19:48,733
Okay, a toast.

373
00:19:49,054 --> 00:19:51,087
Life is full of changes.

374
00:19:51,542 --> 00:19:55,496
One day you have an apartment,
the next day it's a House of Dumplings.

375
00:19:55,592 --> 00:19:59,004
But the important stuff doesn't change.
To the important stuff.

376
00:19:59,099 --> 00:20:00,120
- Here, here.
- Cheers.

377
00:20:00,216 --> 00:20:01,938
- Well said.
- Cheers.

378
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:03,945
To the lemon law.

379
00:20:05,287 --> 00:20:07,009
Self click.

380
00:20:07,105 --> 00:20:10,963
And, by the way, I bought these glasses.
Bought them at Ikea.

381
00:20:11,059 --> 00:20:12,970
These are my glasses!

382
00:20:13,355 --> 00:20:16,066
I love this song.
I haven't heard this in forever.

383
00:20:16,162 --> 00:20:19,159
I'm pretty sure this is a mix tape
you made me in sophomore year.

384
00:20:19,254 --> 00:20:20,690
Yeah, right.

385
00:20:20,786 --> 00:20:24,995
Lily, your apartment makes
the best Shanghai dumplings.

386
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:30,452
<i>I love you, Lily.
Happy Valentine's Day, 1998.</i>
