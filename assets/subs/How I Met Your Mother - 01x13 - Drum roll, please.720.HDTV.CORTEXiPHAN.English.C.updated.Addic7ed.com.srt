<i>Kids, in life there are a lot of
big romantic moments,</i>

3
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:18,382
<i>and they make life worth living.</i>

4
00:00:18,477 --> 00:00:19,821
<i>But here's the problem.</i>

5
00:00:19,916 --> 00:00:21,258
<i>Moments pass.</i>

6
00:00:21,354 --> 00:00:23,944
<i>And lurking just around the corner
from those moments...</i>

7
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:27,541
<i>is a cruel, unshaven bastard named reality.</i>

8
00:00:28,067 --> 00:00:30,236
<i>And so, back in 2006,</i>

9
00:00:30,336 --> 00:00:32,766
<i>on the night of
Claudia and Stuart's wedding,</i>

10
00:00:32,862 --> 00:00:34,524
<i>reality was the enemy.</i>

11
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:36,536
Wow, the Peace Corps?

12
00:00:36,602 --> 00:00:39,615
Yeah, I ship out tomorrow. Two years.

13
00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:41,461
You know, some people say...

14
00:00:41,556 --> 00:00:44,146
the Peace Corps is the most noble thing
a person can do.

15
00:00:44,242 --> 00:00:46,351
To those people I say, 'ls it?'

16
00:00:46,447 --> 00:00:49,378
And usually, they say, 'Yes, it is.'

17
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:51,466
But, Barney, they are so right.

18
00:00:51,562 --> 00:00:53,640
Wish there was something I could do.

19
00:00:53,735 --> 00:00:56,748
Oh, Tanya, I'm so glad you said that.

20
00:00:57,986 --> 00:01:01,119
<i>This wasn't how I'd thought
the night would turn out.</i>

21
00:01:01,214 --> 00:01:04,667
<i>This was finally supposed to be
my big moment with Robin,</i>

22
00:01:04,763 --> 00:01:06,841
<i>but then reality came along.</i>

23
00:01:06,937 --> 00:01:10,517
<i>Robin got called up last minute
to anchor the 11:00 news.</i>

24
00:01:10,612 --> 00:01:12,019
<i>It was her big break.</i>

25
00:01:12,115 --> 00:01:14,639
<i>And I went to the wedding stag.</i>

26
00:01:14,832 --> 00:01:17,520
<i>Then, when I least expected it...</i>

27
00:01:27,235 --> 00:01:30,176
Hey, where the hell
did you disappear to last night?

28
00:01:30,271 --> 00:01:33,203
I had the most amazing night ever.

29
00:01:33,307 --> 00:01:35,993
Tell me about it.
That cake! Best cake I ever had.

30
00:01:36,088 --> 00:01:37,783
Seriously. My stomach was like,

31
00:01:37,879 --> 00:01:40,468
'Hey, bro, I don't know what you're eating,
'cause I don't have any eyes,

32
00:01:40,564 --> 00:01:43,281
'but it's basically awesome.
So keep sending it down gullet alley.'

33
00:01:43,377 --> 00:01:45,295
Yeah, I know. My stomach was like,

34
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:48,555
'Girlfriend, we don't always get along,
but that cake...'

35
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:50,218
Lily?

36
00:01:50,314 --> 00:01:53,734
Oh, right.
Most amazing night ever, and go.

37
00:01:54,117 --> 00:01:56,866
You know, I should tell you, I have a rule.

38
00:01:56,962 --> 00:01:59,242
I never hook up at weddings.

39
00:01:59,327 --> 00:02:01,469
I'm guessing
you haven't always had this rule.

40
00:02:01,565 --> 00:02:04,889
Well, here's the thing.
Those big, romantic moments,

41
00:02:04,985 --> 00:02:07,766
they're great when they happen,
but they're not real.

42
00:02:07,862 --> 00:02:09,907
Exactly. Exactly. Like just now,

43
00:02:10,003 --> 00:02:11,730
when I saw you
doing the Chicken Dance out there,

44
00:02:11,825 --> 00:02:14,511
I'm not gonna lie to you,
big time thunderbolt.

45
00:02:14,606 --> 00:02:17,867
You should see me tap dance.
You'd be down on bended knee.

46
00:02:17,963 --> 00:02:20,243
Sadly, not out of character.

47
00:02:20,393 --> 00:02:22,630
But, I know now, it's just a mirage.

48
00:02:22,725 --> 00:02:25,005
- Wedding goggles.
- Exactly.

49
00:02:25,059 --> 00:02:27,776
And that, in a nutshell,
is why I'm not putting the moves on you.

50
00:02:27,872 --> 00:02:30,813
- This isn't the moves?
- What, you... You think this is the moves?

51
00:02:30,909 --> 00:02:32,603
Believe me, you'd know the moves.

52
00:02:32,699 --> 00:02:35,480
People 10 tables away
would know the moves.

53
00:02:35,576 --> 00:02:38,507
- That's too bad.
- Tell me about it.

54
00:02:38,676 --> 00:02:41,607
You know, I think I have a solution.

55
00:02:41,681 --> 00:02:42,800
Interested.

56
00:02:42,896 --> 00:02:46,540
And to preface this,
we're not gonna sleep together tonight.

57
00:02:46,636 --> 00:02:48,552
Less interested.

58
00:02:48,873 --> 00:02:50,439
- Go ahead.
- Okay.

59
00:02:50,535 --> 00:02:54,882
So the thing that always screws it up
is the next day. Right?

60
00:02:54,978 --> 00:02:58,270
So, why don't we just cut that part out?

61
00:02:58,622 --> 00:03:02,202
- What are you saying?
- I'm saying, I'm here, you're here.

62
00:03:02,298 --> 00:03:04,504
This is a big, romantic wedding.

63
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:07,956
Why don't we just dance
and have a great time?

64
00:03:08,052 --> 00:03:12,205
And then when it's over,
never see each other again.

65
00:03:13,007 --> 00:03:15,492
- Unless...
- No, no unless.

66
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:19,162
No emails, no phone numbers,
not even names.

67
00:03:19,688 --> 00:03:24,492
Tonight, we will make a memory
that will never be tarnished.

68
00:03:25,026 --> 00:03:27,794
And then, when we're old and gray,

69
00:03:27,838 --> 00:03:29,885
we'll look back on this night,

70
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:32,018
and it'll be perfect.

71
00:03:33,305 --> 00:03:35,221
Wow.

72
00:03:36,277 --> 00:03:37,684
- Okay, I'm in.
- Okay.

73
00:03:37,779 --> 00:03:40,955
I guess... What, we'll need fake names?

74
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,158
You can call me Buttercup.

75
00:03:43,501 --> 00:03:47,736
Pleased to meet you, Buttercup.
I'm Lando Calrissian.

76
00:03:48,584 --> 00:03:51,429
Wow, this is kind of exciting.
Our names will forever be shrouded in...

77
00:03:51,525 --> 00:03:53,155
Ted, Ted, Ted, look. I got a bridesmaid.

78
00:03:53,251 --> 00:03:55,392
Ted, look. Look, Ted.
The second hottest bridesmaid!

79
00:03:55,488 --> 00:03:57,442
Ted, look. See you, Ted.

80
00:04:00,571 --> 00:04:01,913
So, I'm Ted.

81
00:04:02,009 --> 00:04:03,925
Victoria.

82
00:04:03,991 --> 00:04:06,923
- But no last names.
- No last names.

83
00:04:08,466 --> 00:04:10,128
What is wrong with you?

84
00:04:10,224 --> 00:04:14,278
Yeah, dude, that is just like
a weenie ass idea.

85
00:04:14,411 --> 00:04:16,841
No, it was awesome. I had a great night.

86
00:04:16,936 --> 00:04:19,654
I'm never going to see her again.
And there's no way to ruin it.

87
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:22,519
Ted, how do I explain this to you?

88
00:04:22,723 --> 00:04:24,416
Last night I ate the best cake of my life.

89
00:04:24,512 --> 00:04:26,782
Now you think I'm gonna let that cake
out of my life? Hell, no.

90
00:04:26,878 --> 00:04:28,221
I'm gonna find out
what bakery made that cake,

91
00:04:28,316 --> 00:04:30,458
and damn it,
I'm gonna get some more cake.

92
00:04:30,554 --> 00:04:32,632
That cake really got to you, huh?

93
00:04:32,728 --> 00:04:34,644
It haunts me.

94
00:04:34,997 --> 00:04:36,913
So, what happened next?

95
00:04:37,139 --> 00:04:40,517
Okay, ground rules have been established.

96
00:04:40,654 --> 00:04:45,459
Now, let's see some of these moves
I've heard so much about.

97
00:04:50,117 --> 00:04:52,033
Wait, wait, wait.

98
00:04:52,130 --> 00:04:56,446
Let's do all the single ladies in this joint
a big favor and steal the bouquet.

99
00:04:56,542 --> 00:04:59,506
Yes, but we'll need a diversion.

100
00:05:00,345 --> 00:05:01,560
Kiss!

101
00:05:01,656 --> 00:05:02,839
Kiss! Kiss!

102
00:05:02,934 --> 00:05:05,588
Kiss, come on. Kiss! Kiss!

103
00:05:05,684 --> 00:05:06,770
Go, go, go.

104
00:05:06,866 --> 00:05:09,551
So, that's what happened to the bouquet.

105
00:05:09,647 --> 00:05:13,739
You know, good for Victoria.
It's such an evil tradition.

106
00:05:13,835 --> 00:05:15,848
- You're not gonna do it at your wedding?
- Oh, yeah!

107
00:05:15,944 --> 00:05:19,172
I'm gonna take that flower grenade
and chuck it into the crowd and scream,

108
00:05:19,268 --> 00:05:21,223
'Crawl for it, bitches!'

109
00:05:22,191 --> 00:05:24,145
It's just what girls do.

110
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:26,219
So, where'd you guys go?

111
00:05:36,959 --> 00:05:38,875
- Very nice.
- Yeah?

112
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:42,489
Okay, I don't really know how to tap dance.

113
00:05:42,585 --> 00:05:44,501
I couldn't tell.

114
00:05:46,069 --> 00:05:49,233
Oh, it's too bad
you're not gonna get some tonight!

115
00:05:49,329 --> 00:05:51,759
Oh, if I wanted some, I could get some.

116
00:05:51,854 --> 00:05:53,421
No, you couldn't.

117
00:05:53,517 --> 00:05:55,274
You're a dude.

118
00:05:55,370 --> 00:05:59,279
- I could get some.
- You could totally get some.

119
00:06:02,563 --> 00:06:04,161
We're not gonna kiss tonight.

120
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:09,819
I mean, if we kiss, all of this becomes real.

121
00:06:09,915 --> 00:06:13,431
You might use too much tongue,
I might not use enough.

122
00:06:13,527 --> 00:06:15,732
And then suddenly, poof, spell's broken.

123
00:06:15,828 --> 00:06:19,493
I will use exactly the right amount
of tongue.

124
00:06:20,176 --> 00:06:22,092
Okay, how about this?

125
00:06:23,724 --> 00:06:27,958
The best part of any first kiss
is the lead up to it.

126
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:31,044
The moment right before the lips touch.

127
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:34,170
It's like a big drum roll.

128
00:06:34,431 --> 00:06:37,559
So, how about tonight...

129
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:40,347
we just stick with the drum roll.

130
00:06:42,071 --> 00:06:44,270
- Okay.
- But we can't kiss.

131
00:06:45,108 --> 00:06:47,024
Okay.

132
00:07:05,725 --> 00:07:08,439
A drum roll? That's it?

133
00:07:08,666 --> 00:07:12,535
So, what? You just...
You said good night, came home,

134
00:07:12,631 --> 00:07:14,748
and performed a drum solo?

135
00:07:15,283 --> 00:07:17,563
Oh, Ted, you're such a doof!

136
00:07:17,649 --> 00:07:19,375
I mean, this girl sounds amazing.

137
00:07:19,471 --> 00:07:21,197
She was completely amazing.

138
00:07:21,293 --> 00:07:25,384
She was amazing and funny
and we connected on every level,

139
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:28,249
and I'm never gonna see her again.

140
00:07:29,092 --> 00:07:30,466
Damn it, I have to see her again.

141
00:07:30,562 --> 00:07:32,478
- Yes!
- Yes!

142
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:34,814
So let's get to work, man.
What else do you know about her?

143
00:07:34,910 --> 00:07:37,339
Nothing, her name's Victoria.
That's all I got.

144
00:07:37,435 --> 00:07:39,065
Wait, Claudia. Claudia would know.

145
00:07:39,161 --> 00:07:41,751
Well, Claudia's on her honeymoon.
She'll be back in two weeks.

146
00:07:41,846 --> 00:07:44,436
- Call her then.
- Yes, two weeks. Good idea.

147
00:07:44,532 --> 00:07:46,417
- I'm calling her now.
- No, Ted.

148
00:07:46,513 --> 00:07:49,326
- You don't mess with a honeymoon.
- Yeah, come on, dude.

149
00:07:49,422 --> 00:07:51,338
Ask her about the cake.

150
00:07:53,833 --> 00:07:55,903
- Ted?
- Hey, Claudia!

151
00:07:56,007 --> 00:07:59,331
Great wedding, beautiful toast,
touching stuff. How's the honeymoon?

152
00:07:59,427 --> 00:08:01,345
Listen, I'm calling because
last night I met this girl,

153
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,071
and I was wondering if you had...

154
00:08:03,167 --> 00:08:06,108
Oh, you have got to be freaking kidding me!

155
00:08:06,203 --> 00:08:07,387
Here we go.

156
00:08:07,482 --> 00:08:10,647
Twenty-four hours ago,
you were begging, begging me...

157
00:08:10,742 --> 00:08:14,451
to bring some other girl to my wedding
and now, what, you're over her?

158
00:08:14,547 --> 00:08:16,463
I've moved on.

159
00:08:16,688 --> 00:08:18,510
What was her name?
Is it my fat cousin Lindsey?

160
00:08:18,606 --> 00:08:20,300
Don't be embarrassed.
She has pretty eyes.

161
00:08:20,396 --> 00:08:23,305
No. Her name was Victoria.
I don't know her last name.

162
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:27,620
Well, lucky for you. I know that guest list
backwards and forwards.

163
00:08:27,716 --> 00:08:29,027
Thank God!

164
00:08:29,122 --> 00:08:34,497
Unlucky for you, there was no Victoria
at my wedding. Goodbye, Ted.

165
00:08:38,296 --> 00:08:40,758
There was no Victoria at the wedding.

166
00:08:40,854 --> 00:08:43,347
Maybe she used a second fake name.

167
00:08:43,443 --> 00:08:45,553
Oh, she's good. She's very good.

168
00:08:45,649 --> 00:08:48,973
Maybe she was a ghost.
That's why she didn't want to kiss you.

169
00:08:49,069 --> 00:08:51,882
Because you'd just pass right through her
and feel really cold for a second.

170
00:08:51,977 --> 00:08:54,119
Oh, my God, I just had a great idea
for a screenplay.

171
00:08:54,215 --> 00:08:56,516
Marshall, she was not a ghost.

172
00:08:56,612 --> 00:08:58,275
I know that she wasn't a ghost.

173
00:08:58,371 --> 00:09:01,918
She picked up a bouquet
proving she had corporeal form.

174
00:09:02,014 --> 00:09:04,061
Wait! She was sitting across
from a couple of bridesmaids.

175
00:09:04,156 --> 00:09:06,266
She must have been at their table.
Maybe they know who she was.

176
00:09:06,362 --> 00:09:10,759
Great! So, how do we get in touch
with the bridesmaids?

177
00:09:12,755 --> 00:09:15,025
This better be good.
I'm about to enter Nirvana.

178
00:09:15,121 --> 00:09:16,878
By the way, I should get you
Nirvana's phone number.

179
00:09:16,974 --> 00:09:18,828
She gives a great massage. Say what?

180
00:09:18,924 --> 00:09:20,840
Barney!

181
00:09:21,033 --> 00:09:22,664
I know the house rules.

182
00:09:24,806 --> 00:09:27,363
Listen, Barney. I saw you talking
to that bridesmaid last night.

183
00:09:27,459 --> 00:09:30,175
- Did you happen to get her phone number?
- You know I did.

184
00:09:30,271 --> 00:09:32,765
Great! I'm gonna need you
to call her for me.

185
00:09:32,861 --> 00:09:34,777
You know I won't.

186
00:09:35,099 --> 00:09:36,185
Why not?

187
00:09:36,281 --> 00:09:39,765
Because, we just hooked up last night.
I can't call the girl the next day.

188
00:09:39,861 --> 00:09:42,674
I have to wait at least, like, forever.

189
00:09:42,770 --> 00:09:45,040
Oh, snap! Never gonna call her.

190
00:09:45,135 --> 00:09:47,278
Besides, she thinks I'm on my way to India.

191
00:09:47,373 --> 00:09:50,875
Oh, come on, Barney. It's for a good cause.

192
00:09:50,985 --> 00:09:55,588
Ted going all castrati over yet another girl
is exactly not a good cause.

193
00:09:55,684 --> 00:09:57,889
Sorry, buddy, I wish I could help you.
My hands are tied.

194
00:09:57,985 --> 00:09:59,680
Oh, no, wait, that was last night.

195
00:10:02,013 --> 00:10:04,250
Okay, Barney,
I'll tell you what I'm gonna do.

196
00:10:04,346 --> 00:10:05,369
You make this call...

197
00:10:05,465 --> 00:10:09,323
and I will go with you to Foxy Boxing.

198
00:10:10,004 --> 00:10:11,315
- Really?
- Yeah.

199
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:13,808
But, you always said
the Foxy Boxing girls were neither foxy,

200
00:10:13,904 --> 00:10:17,101
- nor good at boxing.
- I'm ready to be proven wrong.

201
00:10:17,197 --> 00:10:18,507
- Tonight?
- Tonight!

202
00:10:18,603 --> 00:10:20,169
Dial.

203
00:10:20,265 --> 00:10:23,622
Yeah, Tanya. Turns out I don't leave
for the Peace Corps until tomorrow.

204
00:10:23,718 --> 00:10:25,634
Yeah, I know. It sucks.

205
00:10:25,667 --> 00:10:28,288
Just one fewer day I get to help people.

206
00:10:28,384 --> 00:10:31,165
Anyway, this girl, any idea who she was?

207
00:10:31,261 --> 00:10:33,339
Hold on. What kind of shoes was she...

208
00:10:33,435 --> 00:10:34,841
No, Tanya, he's a dude.

209
00:10:34,937 --> 00:10:36,919
He's not gonna know
what kind of shoes she was wearing.

210
00:10:37,015 --> 00:10:38,134
Actually...

211
00:10:38,229 --> 00:10:40,145
Oh, come on!

212
00:10:40,563 --> 00:10:42,479
Hey!

213
00:10:43,472 --> 00:10:45,422
So, what do you want to do next?
Don't think!

214
00:10:45,518 --> 00:10:48,612
First thing that comes into your mind.

215
00:10:48,682 --> 00:10:51,046
Hold this.

216
00:10:51,751 --> 00:10:53,666
And this.

217
00:10:55,842 --> 00:10:57,758
There she goes.

218
00:10:57,824 --> 00:11:02,010
Apparently, she was
wearing brown shoes...

219
00:11:02,682 --> 00:11:05,206
with little snowflakes on them.

220
00:11:06,359 --> 00:11:08,395
Yeah, they do sound cute.

221
00:11:08,884 --> 00:11:10,800
Any idea who...

222
00:11:11,377 --> 00:11:14,094
Okay. Well, thanks anyway.
Yeah, you take care.

223
00:11:14,190 --> 00:11:15,405
What's...

224
00:11:15,501 --> 00:11:16,492
Tonight?

225
00:11:16,587 --> 00:11:19,049
Well, I'm shipping out pretty early.

226
00:11:19,144 --> 00:11:21,958
So, I won't be able to stay over,
but, yeah, sure, I'd love to.

227
00:11:22,054 --> 00:11:24,195
Okay. I'll talk to you later.

228
00:11:24,291 --> 00:11:26,273
Sorry, Ted, I won't be able
to make Foxy Boxing tonight.

229
00:11:26,369 --> 00:11:27,616
I understand.

230
00:11:27,712 --> 00:11:29,661
Okay. Let's not lose hope.

231
00:11:29,757 --> 00:11:32,346
We'll call the hotel.
Maybe she was staying there.

232
00:11:32,442 --> 00:11:35,287
We'll have them check the registry
for anyone named Victoria.

233
00:11:35,383 --> 00:11:39,455
- Or maybe she goes by Vicky or Tori...
- Or Ictor.

234
00:11:39,571 --> 00:11:42,258
She probably doesn't go by Ictor.

235
00:11:44,173 --> 00:11:48,010
No, you know what? This is fate.
I am never supposed to see this girl again.

236
00:11:48,105 --> 00:11:51,365
That was the whole point of the night.
I've just been saved from myself.

237
00:11:51,461 --> 00:11:53,539
- Let's drink many beers.
- Agreed.

238
00:11:53,635 --> 00:11:56,288
<i>And I thought that was the end of it.
But then...</i>

239
00:12:01,051 --> 00:12:03,449
- Hey, there's the anchor lady.
- Hello.

240
00:12:03,544 --> 00:12:05,430
- How was it?
- Oh, I don't know.

241
00:12:05,526 --> 00:12:07,859
Why don't you ask the new substitute
weekend anchor?

242
00:12:07,955 --> 00:12:10,545
Robin? Thanks, Robin. It was awesome.

243
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:12,846
- Back to you, Robin.
- Congrats!

244
00:12:12,941 --> 00:12:14,412
- Thanks.
- That's so cool.

245
00:12:14,508 --> 00:12:16,522
Yeah, I felt really bad
bailing on Ted though.

246
00:12:16,618 --> 00:12:18,855
Oh, don't even worry about it. In fact...

247
00:12:18,951 --> 00:12:20,966
<i>And then Lily told her the whole story,</i>

248
00:12:21,061 --> 00:12:24,257
<i>right down to the brown shoes
with the little snowflakes on them.</i>

249
00:12:24,353 --> 00:12:26,269
<i>And by the end of it...</i>

250
00:12:27,070 --> 00:12:28,700
What?

251
00:12:28,796 --> 00:12:30,712
I know who she is.

252
00:12:33,877 --> 00:12:37,489
You know who she is?
But you weren't even at the wedding.

253
00:12:37,585 --> 00:12:40,484
Actually I kind of was.

254
00:12:40,941 --> 00:12:42,060
What?

255
00:12:42,156 --> 00:12:44,362
Well, after the newscast I was so excited,

256
00:12:44,458 --> 00:12:48,611
I decided to surprise Ted
by going to the reception.

257
00:12:59,641 --> 00:13:01,431
Oh, damn it.

258
00:13:01,526 --> 00:13:03,061
Oh, stop it.

259
00:13:03,157 --> 00:13:05,073
What the hell?

260
00:13:05,203 --> 00:13:06,545
Hello?

261
00:13:06,641 --> 00:13:07,792
You okay in there?

262
00:13:07,887 --> 00:13:09,803
Yeah, I'm fine!

263
00:13:10,477 --> 00:13:13,790
Just allergies or something. I'm fine.

264
00:13:16,006 --> 00:13:19,426
Listen, do you wanna come
and cry out here?

265
00:13:19,555 --> 00:13:21,537
I've been told I'm an excellent hugger.

266
00:13:21,633 --> 00:13:23,549
Oh, thanks.

267
00:13:23,615 --> 00:13:26,044
But I don't actually cry in front of people...

268
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:29,137
or cry at all for that matter.

269
00:13:30,359 --> 00:13:32,275
Man, it's gross.

270
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:35,794
Does everyone snot up this much
when they cry?

271
00:13:35,890 --> 00:13:39,228
Hey, you're speaking to a fellow snotter.

272
00:13:41,292 --> 00:13:43,208
So, why you crying?

273
00:13:43,241 --> 00:13:46,010
Because you have feelings for Ted.

274
00:13:46,150 --> 00:13:48,416
I don't know. Maybe?

275
00:13:48,515 --> 00:13:52,288
Okay, what is wrong with the two of you?
Seriously!

276
00:13:52,383 --> 00:13:56,059
He likes you, and you like him,
and just be together!

277
00:13:56,155 --> 00:13:58,649
Jeez, Louise,
happiness is not that difficult.

278
00:13:58,744 --> 00:14:00,022
Oh, look, okay.

279
00:14:00,118 --> 00:14:03,635
Yes, I cried in the bathroom
and that was weird.

280
00:14:03,731 --> 00:14:06,192
But that doesn't mean
I'm in love with the guy.

281
00:14:06,288 --> 00:14:08,877
The fact is, I don't know how I feel.

282
00:14:08,973 --> 00:14:10,283
Yes, you do.

283
00:14:10,379 --> 00:14:12,809
Seeing him with someone else
and crying about it?

284
00:14:12,905 --> 00:14:14,631
Guess what? That's how you feel!

285
00:14:14,727 --> 00:14:17,414
That is nothing but how you feel.

286
00:14:18,562 --> 00:14:21,119
Okay, fine, I have feelings for him. Happy?

287
00:14:21,215 --> 00:14:23,131
Kind of, yeah.

288
00:14:24,316 --> 00:14:26,586
But it doesn't change anything.

289
00:14:26,681 --> 00:14:30,834
I still don't wanna get married,
and he's still Ted.

290
00:14:31,157 --> 00:14:34,960
What I should do is just tell him
who Victoria is, so he can be happy.

291
00:14:35,056 --> 00:14:39,564
Or you could tell him that you're into him
and then you could both be happy.

292
00:14:39,659 --> 00:14:41,575
I'm gonna go find him.

293
00:14:42,376 --> 00:14:44,292
Well, wait.

294
00:14:44,294 --> 00:14:46,852
Which one are you gonna tell him?

295
00:14:46,948 --> 00:14:48,864
I have no idea.

296
00:14:49,536 --> 00:14:51,071
And here's the most amazing part.

297
00:14:51,167 --> 00:14:54,395
Because I told her I had converted
all my money to India dollars,

298
00:14:54,491 --> 00:14:57,305
she gave me $50 to take a cab
to the airport.

299
00:14:57,400 --> 00:15:00,495
That's right. I just got paid for sex.

300
00:15:00,852 --> 00:15:02,451
I really should give this money
to the Peace Corps.

301
00:15:02,547 --> 00:15:04,369
They've done so much for me lately.

302
00:15:04,465 --> 00:15:06,381
- Hi, guys.
- Hey.

303
00:15:07,437 --> 00:15:09,099
Ted, can I talk to you outside for a second?

304
00:15:09,195 --> 00:15:10,697
Sure, what's up?

305
00:15:11,976 --> 00:15:14,338
I have to tell you something.

306
00:15:15,588 --> 00:15:17,504
Oh, just get it.

307
00:15:17,986 --> 00:15:20,184
- Hello?
- Ted? It's Stuart.

308
00:15:20,447 --> 00:15:24,518
My lovely bride would like to say
something to you.

309
00:15:27,735 --> 00:15:29,142
Ted.

310
00:15:29,237 --> 00:15:32,087
I'm sorry I hung up on you earlier.

311
00:15:32,114 --> 00:15:35,177
My new husband and vodka cranberry,

312
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:38,954
which cost $10.50
at the freaking airport bar...

313
00:15:39,050 --> 00:15:42,183
<i>- When is this plane going to board?
- Sweet pea.</i>

314
00:15:44,741 --> 00:15:49,919
have helped me realize that
sometimes I can act like a crazy person.

315
00:15:50,014 --> 00:15:54,074
And I don't want my new husband to think
I'm a crazy person.

316
00:15:54,170 --> 00:15:57,399
It's fine, Claudia, don't worry about it.

317
00:15:57,494 --> 00:15:59,828
Marshall wanted to know
where you guys got that cake.

318
00:15:59,924 --> 00:16:01,840
Cake?

319
00:16:02,577 --> 00:16:04,531
Why don't you take this?

320
00:16:05,805 --> 00:16:07,627
Sounds like you could use it.

321
00:16:07,723 --> 00:16:10,273
Thanks. You're very sweet.

322
00:16:10,696 --> 00:16:13,892
So, are you a friend of the bride or groom?

323
00:16:13,988 --> 00:16:16,098
We got it at this little bakery downtown.

324
00:16:16,194 --> 00:16:17,697
Actually, neither.

325
00:16:17,792 --> 00:16:19,326
It's called the Buttercup Bakery.

326
00:16:19,422 --> 00:16:21,244
Pleased to meet you, Buttercup.

327
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:23,256
I made the cake.

328
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:27,316
She made the cake.

329
00:16:32,081 --> 00:16:33,551
Buttercup Bakery!

330
00:16:33,647 --> 00:16:36,268
She wasn't on the guest list,
because she wasn't a guest.

331
00:16:36,364 --> 00:16:37,835
She made the cake!

332
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:41,407
She made that cake. Ted, this is the girl.

333
00:16:41,766 --> 00:16:43,556
You gotta marry her. Today.

334
00:16:43,652 --> 00:16:45,122
She has to move in with us.

335
00:16:45,218 --> 00:16:47,647
- I'm going down to that bakery.
- No, no, don't do it.

336
00:16:47,743 --> 00:16:50,013
Baby, what are you talking about?

337
00:16:50,108 --> 00:16:53,241
Yeah, all day long you've been busting
my apple bag about finding this girl.

338
00:16:53,337 --> 00:16:57,237
Well, I just think that
maybe she's not that into you.

339
00:16:57,333 --> 00:17:00,997
And that's why
she didn't give you her number.

340
00:17:01,328 --> 00:17:04,620
Robin, care to chime in with anything?

341
00:17:06,379 --> 00:17:08,295
Yes.

342
00:17:08,457 --> 00:17:10,373
Ted,

343
00:17:12,676 --> 00:17:14,019
go get her.

344
00:17:14,115 --> 00:17:15,617
Going. Getting!

345
00:17:15,713 --> 00:17:16,992
Ted. Oh, my gosh, I love this moment.

346
00:17:17,087 --> 00:17:18,142
You know why? 'Cause I'm gonna say it.

347
00:17:18,238 --> 00:17:19,421
And this time,
you're actually gonna say yes.

348
00:17:19,517 --> 00:17:22,074
You ready? You ready to say yes?
Ted, suit up!

349
00:17:22,170 --> 00:17:23,384
Yes!

350
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:25,396
- No.
- Oh, come on!

351
00:17:27,732 --> 00:17:30,833
- Guess we were gone a while.
- Oh, that's too bad.

352
00:17:30,929 --> 00:17:34,186
I was looking forward to one last dance.

353
00:17:53,879 --> 00:17:55,573
Why, yes, I am.

354
00:17:55,669 --> 00:17:57,619
Sorry, I could tell
what you were just thinking.

355
00:17:57,715 --> 00:17:59,760
Wow, what was I just thinking?

356
00:17:59,856 --> 00:18:03,181
Damn, he's looking mighty fine in that tux.

357
00:18:03,277 --> 00:18:05,930
- You got me. You are good.
- Yeah.

358
00:18:06,026 --> 00:18:08,072
You know, I don't look like this every day.

359
00:18:08,168 --> 00:18:11,109
On a real weekend, the real Ted wears
a pair of jeans and a sweatshirt...

360
00:18:11,204 --> 00:18:13,240
with bleach stains on it.

361
00:18:13,666 --> 00:18:16,108
The real Ted sounds real sexy.

362
00:18:17,725 --> 00:18:20,819
It's too bad I'll never get to see it.

363
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:27,634
Buttercup Bakery. This is it.

364
00:18:27,730 --> 00:18:30,580
Good luck, dude. Grab me a cupcake.

365
00:18:33,516 --> 00:18:35,848
Ted? You still with us?

366
00:18:48,379 --> 00:18:50,295
Tell me your last name.

367
00:18:53,526 --> 00:18:55,764
You know, there's one little flaw in our plan.

368
00:18:55,859 --> 00:18:57,202
What's that?

369
00:18:57,297 --> 00:18:59,855
I'm gonna go home tonight
with a lot of great memories,

370
00:18:59,951 --> 00:19:02,231
and one really sucky memory.

371
00:19:02,668 --> 00:19:05,925
The memory of you walking out that door.

372
00:19:08,805 --> 00:19:10,180
Hey, Ted.

373
00:19:10,275 --> 00:19:12,191
Yeah?

374
00:19:12,833 --> 00:19:16,212
Close your eyes and count to five.

375
00:19:20,056 --> 00:19:21,783
One.

376
00:19:21,879 --> 00:19:23,795
Two.

377
00:19:23,861 --> 00:19:25,777
Three.

378
00:19:26,610 --> 00:19:28,526
Four.

379
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:31,626
Five.

380
00:19:42,462 --> 00:19:46,331
<i>Until our dying days, we'll remember
everything about that night...</i>

381
00:19:46,426 --> 00:19:48,342
<i>as perfect.</i>

382
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:50,554
Maybe we both need that.

383
00:19:50,678 --> 00:19:52,819
I mean, so many things go wrong in life,

384
00:19:52,915 --> 00:19:54,673
but this is the one thing that never will.

385
00:19:54,769 --> 00:19:58,594
It will always, always be pure,

386
00:19:58,701 --> 00:20:00,641
unadulterated, awesome.

387
00:20:02,121 --> 00:20:04,647
If I walk in there, I'm robbing both of us
of what could be...

388
00:20:04,742 --> 00:20:07,299
The meter's running, dude.
Crap or get off the pot.

389
00:20:07,395 --> 00:20:09,311
Yeah, yeah, I'm going.

390
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:33,956
Oh, thank God!
