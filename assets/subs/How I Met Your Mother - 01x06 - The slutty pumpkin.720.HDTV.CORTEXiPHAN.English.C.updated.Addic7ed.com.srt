00:00:13,638 --> 00:00:15,710
You know how Aunt Robin's
a big fan of Halloween?

3
00:00:15,805 --> 00:00:18,258
Always dressing up in crazy costumes?

4
00:00:18,354 --> 00:00:20,010
Well, she wasn't always that way.

5
00:00:20,106 --> 00:00:23,643
Back in 2005, she thought she was
too cool for Halloween.

6
00:00:23,738 --> 00:00:25,648
<i>Unlike Aunt Lily.</i>

7
00:00:25,809 --> 00:00:28,263
- Guess what came in the mail today?
- Our costumes?

8
00:00:28,358 --> 00:00:29,855
- Do they rule?
- They rule.

9
00:00:29,951 --> 00:00:31,354
And yours is 100% wool,

10
00:00:31,449 --> 00:00:34,284
so you won't get hypothermia like last year.

11
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:36,607
Tarzan nipple blue.

12
00:00:37,757 --> 00:00:38,968
You know what I love about Halloween?

13
00:00:39,063 --> 00:00:43,142
It's the one night of the year chicks use
to unleash their inner ho-bag.

14
00:00:43,237 --> 00:00:45,946
If a girl dresses up as a witch,
she's a slutty witch.

15
00:00:46,042 --> 00:00:48,718
If she's a cat, she's a slutty cat.

16
00:00:48,814 --> 00:00:51,898
- If she's a nurse...
- Wow. We get it.

17
00:00:52,127 --> 00:00:54,037
She's a slutty nurse.

18
00:00:54,357 --> 00:00:55,568
Robin, what are you doing for Halloween?

19
00:00:55,663 --> 00:00:56,907
Oh, I don't know.

20
00:00:57,002 --> 00:00:59,391
Probably hanging out with Mike,
this guy I've been seeing.

21
00:00:59,487 --> 00:01:01,397
Mike? There's a Mike?

22
00:01:01,399 --> 00:01:03,407
You have a boyfriend
and you haven't told us?

23
00:01:03,502 --> 00:01:04,649
No. I mean, he's not my boyfriend.

24
00:01:04,744 --> 00:01:07,644
He's just this guy I've been seeing
for a couple of weeks.

25
00:01:07,739 --> 00:01:08,663
Boyfriend.

26
00:01:08,759 --> 00:01:10,161
So why haven't we met him?

27
00:01:10,256 --> 00:01:12,773
We're not really ready to go public yet.

28
00:01:12,869 --> 00:01:14,779
Married.

29
00:01:15,792 --> 00:01:17,736
How about we go
on a Halloween double-date?

30
00:01:17,832 --> 00:01:19,712
I don't know, we were kind of thinking
about staying at home...

31
00:01:19,807 --> 00:01:22,405
and dressing up as naked people.

32
00:01:23,248 --> 00:01:25,383
Come on, Robin, trot out your new fella.

33
00:01:25,478 --> 00:01:27,517
Let us judge and evaluate him
behind your back.

34
00:01:27,613 --> 00:01:29,522
It'll be fun.

35
00:01:29,843 --> 00:01:31,149
Hey, Ted, you'll never guess
what happened?

36
00:01:31,245 --> 00:01:33,252
- Your costumes came?
- Our costumes... Yes.

37
00:01:33,348 --> 00:01:35,578
That is why we're best friends.

38
00:01:35,674 --> 00:01:37,140
Hey, Ted,
what are you doing for Halloween?

39
00:01:37,235 --> 00:01:39,145
- Well...
- What?

40
00:01:39,275 --> 00:01:41,855
Every Halloween,
Ted waits for the slutty pumpkin.

41
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:42,875
That's right.

44
00:01:46,539 --> 00:01:48,448
It was four years ago.

45
00:01:48,514 --> 00:01:50,681
<i>I was at this Halloween party
up on the roof of our building,</i>

46
00:01:50,776 --> 00:01:53,007
<i>about to call it an early night,
when out of nowhere...</i>

47
00:01:53,103 --> 00:01:57,080
<i>appeared this girl
in the sexiest pumpkin costume.</i>

48
00:01:57,148 --> 00:01:59,794
Wait, how can a pumpkin costume
be sexy?

49
00:01:59,889 --> 00:02:02,649
It was carved in strategic places.

50
00:02:02,693 --> 00:02:05,019
<i>So, we're at the
bar and I see her mix...</i>

51
00:02:05,114 --> 00:02:06,644
- Kahlúa and...
- Kahlúa and root beer.

52
00:02:06,739 --> 00:02:08,396
A cocktail she invented herself.

53
00:02:08,492 --> 00:02:10,244
- And she...
- And she called it the Tootsie Roll.

54
00:02:10,339 --> 00:02:11,295
- Because...
- Because it tastes...

55
00:02:11,391 --> 00:02:12,730
like an alcoholic Tootsie Roll.

56
00:02:12,825 --> 00:02:15,023
Hey, can I please tell the story?

57
00:02:15,119 --> 00:02:16,775
So we had this instant connection.

58
00:02:16,871 --> 00:02:18,401
She gave me her number. But then...

59
00:02:18,496 --> 00:02:20,121
Something went terribly wrong.

60
00:02:20,217 --> 00:02:22,127
Guys!

61
00:02:22,384 --> 00:02:24,613
Something went terribly wrong.

62
00:02:24,709 --> 00:02:26,618
Happy Halloween.

63
00:02:27,673 --> 00:02:28,851
Sonny, where's Cher?

64
00:02:28,947 --> 00:02:31,057
- Cher.
- Right here, babe.

65
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:34,810
I just met the perfect woman.

66
00:02:34,905 --> 00:02:38,155
<i>She's funny, she's beautiful,
she loves Star Wars.</i>

67
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:40,066
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What's her take on Ewoks?

68
00:02:40,162 --> 00:02:41,628
- Loves them.
- Oh, good.

69
00:02:41,723 --> 00:02:43,508
I don't know why people
are so cynical about Ewoks.

70
00:02:43,603 --> 00:02:45,992
The Rebellion would've failed
without the Ewoks.

71
00:02:46,088 --> 00:02:47,522
And get this. She's a marine biologist.

72
00:02:47,618 --> 00:02:49,465
She spent a year in Antarctica
studying penguins.

73
00:02:49,561 --> 00:02:50,900
Oh, penguins are cool.

74
00:02:50,995 --> 00:02:54,309
Kind of like black-and-white Ewoks.
I approve.

75
00:02:54,404 --> 00:02:56,539
Hey, where's my Kit Kat?
I put it right here on this table.

76
00:02:56,635 --> 00:02:58,546
I don't know,
but we have plenty of chocolate here.

77
00:02:58,642 --> 00:03:00,873
No, no, no, you don't understand.
I need that Kit Kat.

78
00:03:00,968 --> 00:03:03,102
She wrote her number on that wrapper.
Where is it?

79
00:03:03,198 --> 00:03:05,108
Uh-oh.

80
00:03:06,384 --> 00:03:10,605
Hey, Dracula, come on. Give me the candy.
Give me it!

81
00:03:12,501 --> 00:03:15,829
Where's the Kit Kat? Where's the Kit Kat?

82
00:03:16,613 --> 00:03:19,225
Never found her number.
Never saw her again.

83
00:03:19,321 --> 00:03:20,851
But every year they have
a Halloween party...

84
00:03:20,946 --> 00:03:22,794
up on the roof, so that's where I'll be.

85
00:03:22,889 --> 00:03:24,546
You know, Ted, it's been four years.

86
00:03:24,641 --> 00:03:26,808
She could be engaged, or married,

87
00:03:26,904 --> 00:03:29,315
or, God forbid, fat.

88
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:32,161
I don't know, I got a feeling.

89
00:03:32,257 --> 00:03:33,341
This could be the year.

90
00:03:33,436 --> 00:03:36,590
Halloween is a night of wonder and magic.

91
00:03:36,686 --> 00:03:38,852
All right, bring the mockery.
Fine. I can take it.

92
00:03:38,948 --> 00:03:40,382
Come on,
wouldn't it be the coolest story ever...

93
00:03:40,478 --> 00:03:44,013
if the slutty pumpkin turned out
to be my future wife?

94
00:03:44,109 --> 00:03:46,180
Oh, on the off chance that
that could happen,

95
00:03:46,276 --> 00:03:50,099
maybe we should stop calling her
the slutty pumpkin.

96
00:03:50,195 --> 00:03:51,597
Good idea.

97
00:03:51,693 --> 00:03:54,783
Ted, is your world ready
to be rocked?

98
00:03:56,472 --> 00:03:58,382
Can't wait.

99
00:04:00,986 --> 00:04:03,343
So, what do you think?

100
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:05,033
So, what do you think?

101
00:04:06,435 --> 00:04:08,027
Wow!

102
00:04:08,123 --> 00:04:09,398
Marshall, are you wearing eyeliner?

103
00:04:09,493 --> 00:04:11,847
Oh, yeah. Weirdly hot, right?

104
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:15,547
We are so gonna win
the costume contest this year.

105
00:04:15,643 --> 00:04:18,382
First prize, a $50 gift certificate at the bar.

106
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:20,294
And how much did you pay
for your costumes?

107
00:04:20,389 --> 00:04:21,473
$100.

108
00:04:21,569 --> 00:04:23,479
Each.

109
00:04:23,544 --> 00:04:25,647
Well, I think you guys look great.

110
00:04:25,743 --> 00:04:28,770
What are you going as?
Oh, like I even need to ask.

111
00:04:28,865 --> 00:04:30,808
Hey, I want the slutty pumpkin
to recognize me,

112
00:04:30,904 --> 00:04:33,745
and she knows me as a hanging chad.

113
00:04:35,046 --> 00:04:36,416
What? She thought it was hilarious.

114
00:04:36,512 --> 00:04:37,850
Yeah, four years ago.

115
00:04:37,945 --> 00:04:40,972
But nobody remembers
what the hell a hanging chad is.

116
00:04:41,068 --> 00:04:43,649
What a sad commentary
on our national attention span,

117
00:04:43,744 --> 00:04:47,472
that we could forget such a turbulent time
in our political history.

118
00:04:47,568 --> 00:04:50,053
Sad commentary.

119
00:04:50,149 --> 00:04:51,487
All right, Polly gotta pee.

120
00:04:51,582 --> 00:04:53,492
Again?

121
00:04:53,558 --> 00:04:57,616
- Where are you going?
- It's an elaborate costume.

122
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,457
No, no, not again. Not this year.

123
00:05:22,552 --> 00:05:25,260
You're going as my wingman.
Flightsuit up.

124
00:05:25,356 --> 00:05:27,746
No thanks.
I'm sticking with the hanging chad.

125
00:05:27,841 --> 00:05:29,275
Oh, you're dangerous, Maverick.

126
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:32,621
Your ego's writing checks
your body can't cash.

127
00:05:32,716 --> 00:05:34,626
Okay.

128
00:05:35,233 --> 00:05:37,591
Here's the plan, and I crap you not.

129
00:05:37,686 --> 00:05:41,924
I'm getting us into
the Victoria's Secret Halloween party.

130
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:46,449
Trust me. By the end of the night,
your chad will not be hanging.

131
00:05:47,194 --> 00:05:49,074
We can get rejected by supermodels
any night of the year.

132
00:05:49,170 --> 00:05:50,636
Tonight, I'm going up to the roof,

133
00:05:50,731 --> 00:05:53,471
I'm gonna have a few beers,
I'm gonna wait for the slutty pumpkin.

134
00:05:53,566 --> 00:05:55,476
It's just what I do.

135
00:05:56,019 --> 00:05:59,461
Victoria's Secret models prancing around
in bras and panties,

136
00:05:59,556 --> 00:06:03,922
or Yale preppies reuniting
their stupid a cappella group.

137
00:06:04,017 --> 00:06:05,992
What's that, left hand? Right hand sucks?

138
00:06:06,088 --> 00:06:07,681
Word.

139
00:06:07,777 --> 00:06:08,764
I'm heading up to the roof.

140
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:10,644
Well, boys,
looks like it's just the three of us.

141
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:13,743
What's that? Self-five? Nice. We out.

142
00:06:15,806 --> 00:06:17,207
Hey, chad. How's it hanging?

143
00:06:17,303 --> 00:06:19,334
Hey, wordplay. Funny.

144
00:06:21,223 --> 00:06:22,529
Nice outfit.

145
00:06:22,625 --> 00:06:25,060
- I'm a parrot.
- You sure are.

146
00:06:25,492 --> 00:06:27,116
- Where's Mike?
- He's meeting me here.

147
00:06:27,212 --> 00:06:29,316
I ran late covering
the Halloween parade in the Village.

148
00:06:29,411 --> 00:06:32,055
There are, like,
a zillion gay pirates this year.

149
00:06:32,151 --> 00:06:35,018
Seriously, does my eyeliner look okay?

150
00:06:35,114 --> 00:06:37,023
Yes, it's weirdly hot.

151
00:06:37,568 --> 00:06:38,491
So, where's your costume?

152
00:06:39,606 --> 00:06:41,614
You know, Mike and I joked
about doing something together,

153
00:06:41,709 --> 00:06:44,225
but we decided not to dress up.

154
00:06:46,075 --> 00:06:47,094
Oh, jeez.

155
00:06:47,189 --> 00:06:48,974
Hi.

156
00:06:49,069 --> 00:06:52,702
Everyone, this is Michael.
That is not his real hair.

157
00:06:52,797 --> 00:06:54,741
Where's your costume, Gretel?

158
00:06:54,836 --> 00:06:56,175
You thought I was...

159
00:06:56,270 --> 00:06:57,608
Oh, I was just kidding.

160
00:06:57,704 --> 00:07:02,979
I gotta stop making jokes in e-mails.
It's so hard to convey tone.

161
00:07:02,993 --> 00:07:05,022
I think we got them beat.

162
00:07:08,569 --> 00:07:10,067
I can't believe you talked me into this.

163
00:07:10,162 --> 00:07:12,922
I didn't. You followed me up here.

164
00:07:13,125 --> 00:07:14,782
This party sucks.

165
00:07:14,878 --> 00:07:16,988
There's seven chicks here.

166
00:07:18,127 --> 00:07:20,075
There's six chicks here.

167
00:07:20,613 --> 00:07:23,671
Relax. The night is young.
It's gonna get better.

168
00:07:23,767 --> 00:07:24,882
Ladies and gentlemen,

169
00:07:24,977 --> 00:07:28,164
as on pitch as they were at Spring Fling '95,

170
00:07:28,259 --> 00:07:31,127
it's my pleasure to welcome back
The Shagarats.

171
00:07:52,478 --> 00:07:56,715
What be a pirate's favorite kind of sweater?

172
00:07:57,290 --> 00:07:59,200
Argyle.

173
00:08:00,827 --> 00:08:03,238
And what be a pirate's...

174
00:08:03,407 --> 00:08:06,709
favorite fast food restaurant?

175
00:08:07,549 --> 00:08:09,459
Arby's.

176
00:08:10,321 --> 00:08:13,000
'Twould think it would be Arby's.

177
00:08:13,061 --> 00:08:16,064
But actually it's Long John Silver's.

178
00:08:17,139 --> 00:08:20,548
Actually, I kind of need this hand to eat.

179
00:08:22,556 --> 00:08:23,767
Oh, yeah.

180
00:08:25,009 --> 00:08:27,526
- Oh, thank you.
- I'm starving.

181
00:08:30,075 --> 00:08:33,134
It's so nice to meet you, Mike.
You guys are really cute together.

182
00:08:33,229 --> 00:08:35,460
Yeah. We've been spending
a lot of time together.

183
00:08:35,555 --> 00:08:38,997
We're even getting to that point
where we finish each other's...

184
00:08:39,092 --> 00:08:41,036
- This cheeseburger is so...
- Good.

185
00:08:41,131 --> 00:08:43,041
See?

186
00:08:43,872 --> 00:08:46,165
I think you won the dish-off tonight, baby.

187
00:08:46,261 --> 00:08:49,798
This steak totally bitch-slapped
my pork chops.

188
00:08:49,893 --> 00:08:51,136
That may be true.

189
00:08:51,232 --> 00:08:54,991
But your rice pilaf
kicked my spinach in the crotch so hard,

190
00:08:55,087 --> 00:08:57,116
it threw up a little bit.

191
00:09:00,535 --> 00:09:02,734
Robin, you have to try this chicken.

192
00:09:02,829 --> 00:09:05,506
Oh, no, that's good. I'm okay. Thanks.

193
00:09:05,601 --> 00:09:06,589
It's really tasty.

194
00:09:06,684 --> 00:09:10,093
I'm just really feeling this cheeseburger.

195
00:09:10,699 --> 00:09:12,483
Come on, just try a little bite.

196
00:09:12,579 --> 00:09:15,419
Dude, I'm kind of in the zone here.

197
00:09:18,123 --> 00:09:20,033
Oh, for God's sakes.

198
00:09:22,425 --> 00:09:24,334
Really tasty.

199
00:09:36,858 --> 00:09:38,768
- Hey.
- Hey.

200
00:09:40,649 --> 00:09:45,356
So, what does a fella have to do
to get lei-ed around here?

201
00:09:46,321 --> 00:09:48,231
Yeah.

202
00:09:48,264 --> 00:09:51,251
Right.'Cause I'm wearing a lei.

203
00:09:51,482 --> 00:09:52,438
God.

204
00:09:52,533 --> 00:09:55,083
It isn't funny if you explain the joke.

205
00:09:57,568 --> 00:10:00,116
- Let's bail.
- No, Barney, come on. I'm having fun.

206
00:10:00,212 --> 00:10:03,048
Plus, it's really great
to see all these guys again.

207
00:10:03,143 --> 00:10:05,374
Name one person you know at this party.

208
00:10:05,469 --> 00:10:07,379
Well, there's Ninja,

209
00:10:08,082 --> 00:10:10,185
Back of Horse.
Hey, where's Front of Horse?

210
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:12,796
That guy's a riot, where is he?

211
00:10:13,941 --> 00:10:15,056
Okay, I'm leaving.

212
00:10:15,152 --> 00:10:18,243
But just know that
this Victoria's Secret party is on a yacht.

213
00:10:18,338 --> 00:10:20,569
And what will be sticking to that yacht?

214
00:10:20,664 --> 00:10:22,574
The Barnacle.

215
00:10:22,894 --> 00:10:25,284
- Really? That's the nickname now?
- Yeah, the Barnacle.

216
00:10:25,379 --> 00:10:27,571
- The Barnacle?
- That's it.

217
00:10:28,024 --> 00:10:29,330
Barnacle out.

218
00:10:29,425 --> 00:10:31,335
Have fun, Barnacle.

219
00:10:33,696 --> 00:10:35,479
So, do you like Mike?

220
00:10:35,575 --> 00:10:36,945
Do you like Mike?

221
00:10:37,041 --> 00:10:38,825
Of course I do. Why?

222
00:10:38,921 --> 00:10:40,418
It just doesn't seem like it.

223
00:10:40,514 --> 00:10:42,776
You won't share your food,
you won't wear a costume.

224
00:10:42,871 --> 00:10:46,313
Oh, Lily, you know me.
I'm just not into all that coupley stuff.

225
00:10:46,408 --> 00:10:49,690
Okay, I know that stuff
looks dumb from the outside.

226
00:10:49,786 --> 00:10:53,099
But it's kind of the greatest thing
in the world when you're a part of it.

227
00:10:53,195 --> 00:10:55,488
If you just gave it a chance,
you might like it.

228
00:10:55,584 --> 00:10:58,388
Are you trying to get me to join a cult?

229
00:10:58,484 --> 00:10:59,981
Robin, Mike likes you.

230
00:11:00,077 --> 00:11:02,722
If you don't start meeting him halfway,
you're gonna lose him.

231
00:11:02,817 --> 00:11:03,868
What?

232
00:11:03,964 --> 00:11:05,525
Look, it's Halloween.

233
00:11:05,621 --> 00:11:07,564
Just put on the girlfriend costume
for a night.

234
00:11:07,659 --> 00:11:10,663
Okay. Well, what am I supposed to do?

235
00:11:11,292 --> 00:11:14,064
Buy him a giant teddy bear or something?

236
00:11:14,159 --> 00:11:17,325
How about you start by sharing dessert.

237
00:11:18,047 --> 00:11:19,289
I can share dessert.

238
00:11:19,385 --> 00:11:21,294
Good.

239
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,081
He better want the brownie sundae.

240
00:11:23,176 --> 00:11:26,585
But, yeah.
Yeah, I can totally share. Yeah.

241
00:11:32,834 --> 00:11:35,256
- Barney? What, you're back?
- That's right.

242
00:11:35,351 --> 00:11:37,381
In a totally new costume.

243
00:11:37,391 --> 00:11:40,068
Every Halloween, I bring a spare costume...

244
00:11:40,163 --> 00:11:42,489
in case I strike out
with the hottest girl at the party.

245
00:11:42,585 --> 00:11:46,663
That way I have a second chance
to make a first impression.

246
00:11:46,759 --> 00:11:47,841
What's with the face?

247
00:11:47,937 --> 00:11:50,550
It's half 'you're pathetic,'
half 'I have to pee.'

248
00:11:50,645 --> 00:11:51,633
So go to the bathroom.

249
00:11:51,729 --> 00:11:54,310
No, there's a huge line.
I don't wanna miss the slutty pumpkin.

250
00:11:54,405 --> 00:11:56,315
So pee off the roof.

251
00:11:56,413 --> 00:11:57,719
Ted, pee off the roof.

252
00:11:57,814 --> 00:12:01,064
Whoa, I wouldn't do that if I were you.
There's people walking down there.

253
00:12:01,159 --> 00:12:03,422
Come on, Ted.
Who are you gonna listen to?

254
00:12:03,517 --> 00:12:06,196
Me or Mr. Goody-Goody over there?

255
00:12:06,863 --> 00:12:09,795
Yeah, whatever. You guys got some weed?

256
00:12:09,890 --> 00:12:10,257
A little to the left, Marshall.

257
00:12:10,352 --> 00:12:12,279
A little to the left, Marshall.

258
00:12:12,375 --> 00:12:13,554
Lily, squat down.

259
00:12:13,649 --> 00:12:15,243
This is gonna be a slaughter.

260
00:12:15,339 --> 00:12:19,067
None of these other costumes
even come close to ours.

261
00:12:19,162 --> 00:12:21,072
Take the damn picture.

262
00:12:22,061 --> 00:12:23,718
- Got it.
- Nice.

263
00:12:23,813 --> 00:12:25,853
I still think we should've won
as Sonny and Cher.

264
00:12:25,949 --> 00:12:28,306
Maybe if I'd worn the red dress.

265
00:12:28,402 --> 00:12:30,674
If I could turn back time...

266
00:12:32,193 --> 00:12:35,825
Wow. This sundae looks so good,
I could eat the whole thing.

267
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:41,083
But I would much rather share this small,
one-scoop sundae with you, Mike.

268
00:12:41,178 --> 00:12:42,899
Apple tart, excellent choice, Lilypad.

269
00:12:42,994 --> 00:12:44,904
Thanks, Marshmallow.

270
00:12:45,352 --> 00:12:48,654
Well, let's dig in, Microwave Oven.

271
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:53,955
Let me guess.

272
00:12:54,050 --> 00:12:57,332
Every guy's used the lei-ed line
on you tonight, huh?

273
00:12:57,428 --> 00:12:58,511
You wouldn't believe.

274
00:12:59,042 --> 00:13:01,152
I apologize for my gender.

275
00:13:01,241 --> 00:13:04,013
Let me make it up to you.
Make you a drink.

276
00:13:04,109 --> 00:13:06,275
You certainly are a charming devil.

277
00:13:06,371 --> 00:13:08,500
I'm also a horny devil.

278
00:13:09,461 --> 00:13:11,055
Yeah.

279
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:14,430
No.

280
00:13:17,905 --> 00:13:19,815
Oh, go to hell.

281
00:13:23,767 --> 00:13:26,826
You know, if you guys like tiramisu,
we found this little Italian place...

282
00:13:26,921 --> 00:13:29,681
No, you found it. I came with you.

283
00:13:29,693 --> 00:13:31,445
But go on.

284
00:13:31,541 --> 00:13:33,421
I'm just saying we love tiramisu.

285
00:13:33,517 --> 00:13:34,727
I cannot get enough of it.

286
00:13:34,823 --> 00:13:36,353
We're crazy for the stuff.

287
00:13:36,448 --> 00:13:38,802
I'm crazy and you're crazy...

288
00:13:39,538 --> 00:13:41,448
for tiramisu.

289
00:13:42,024 --> 00:13:43,649
We love tiramisu.

290
00:13:43,745 --> 00:13:44,924
Am I wrong saying that?

291
00:13:45,019 --> 00:13:48,014
No, no, no. I mean,
it just sounds a little bit weird, doesn't it?

292
00:13:48,109 --> 00:13:49,607
We love tiramisu.

293
00:13:49,702 --> 00:13:53,272
Is it really a group activity,
loving tiramisu?

294
00:13:53,367 --> 00:13:55,277
Right?

295
00:13:56,999 --> 00:14:00,651
So, this Italian place. How is their cannoli?

296
00:14:01,810 --> 00:14:03,720
Easy there, hungry.

297
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:10,755
Yeah, looks like we're both hungry.

298
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:13,891
- Hey, is that Gary Oldman?
- Where?

299
00:14:16,721 --> 00:14:18,631
I don't see...

300
00:14:23,571 --> 00:14:25,481
Brain freeze.

301
00:14:27,299 --> 00:14:29,625
- Okay, Victoria's Secret party, right now.
- Nope.

302
00:14:29,721 --> 00:14:31,919
Come on, I can't stand
watching my delusional friend...

303
00:14:32,015 --> 00:14:33,704
waste another precious Halloween.

304
00:14:33,799 --> 00:14:35,870
Ted, the slutty pumpkin is not coming.

305
00:14:35,966 --> 00:14:37,399
She might.

306
00:14:37,495 --> 00:14:39,566
Come on, Barney,
this is not about the odds.

307
00:14:39,661 --> 00:14:40,650
It's about believing.

308
00:14:40,745 --> 00:14:43,167
This girl, she represents something to me.

309
00:14:43,262 --> 00:14:45,172
I don't know, hope.

310
00:14:46,895 --> 00:14:48,552
Wow.

311
00:14:48,647 --> 00:14:52,056
I did not understand a word you just said.

312
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:56,027
Lingerie models on a boat!

313
00:14:57,186 --> 00:14:58,174
See you.

314
00:14:58,270 --> 00:15:00,236
No. See you.

315
00:15:05,783 --> 00:15:07,974
Wanna drink the melty part?

316
00:15:08,588 --> 00:15:13,458
You know what, it's getting late.
I think I'm gonna take off.

317
00:15:13,462 --> 00:15:14,641
Hey.

318
00:15:14,736 --> 00:15:16,616
I thought we were gonna follow
those bread crumbs...

319
00:15:16,712 --> 00:15:18,464
back to my place, Hansel.

320
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,981
Robin, I don't get the sense
you like being with me.

321
00:15:21,077 --> 00:15:22,287
I like being with you.

322
00:15:22,383 --> 00:15:24,041
Not as much as you like being alone.

323
00:15:24,136 --> 00:15:26,175
You like eating your own food,

324
00:15:26,270 --> 00:15:28,023
sleeping in your own bed,
doing your own crosswords.

325
00:15:28,118 --> 00:15:30,028
Well, who uses ink?

326
00:15:31,018 --> 00:15:31,974
Sorry.

327
00:15:32,069 --> 00:15:34,300
Okay, I'm a bit set in my ways.

328
00:15:34,396 --> 00:15:35,988
That doesn't mean that this won't work.

329
00:15:36,084 --> 00:15:38,194
Actually, it kind of does.

330
00:15:38,983 --> 00:15:40,194
Wait, are we breaking up?

331
00:15:40,289 --> 00:15:42,700
No, we aren't breaking up.

332
00:15:43,221 --> 00:15:45,448
I'm breaking up with you.

333
00:15:49,752 --> 00:15:53,729
<i>And then,
just when I was about to lose hope.</i>

334
00:15:57,909 --> 00:16:00,872
She spent a year in Antarctica
studying penguins.

335
00:16:00,967 --> 00:16:02,877
<i>Kahlúa. Root beer.</i>

336
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:07,291
<i>Could this penguin be the slutty pumpkin?</i>

337
00:16:14,143 --> 00:16:15,258
Excuse me?

338
00:16:15,354 --> 00:16:16,564
This is gonna sound crazy,

339
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:19,560
but I met someone up on this roof
four years ago...

340
00:16:19,655 --> 00:16:23,957
and they mixed that cocktail,
and they loved penguins.

341
00:16:24,148 --> 00:16:26,421
By any chance, was that you?

342
00:16:29,182 --> 00:16:30,489
It's you.

343
00:16:30,584 --> 00:16:34,822
- Everyone thought I was crazy, but I...
- You are such a loser.

344
00:16:34,917 --> 00:16:37,116
Come on, I came back for you, Ted.

345
00:16:37,659 --> 00:16:41,101
I penguin-suited up
to show you the error of your ways.

346
00:16:41,196 --> 00:16:44,095
And to score Hula Girl's number.
Check and check.

347
00:16:44,191 --> 00:16:46,463
- Unbelievable.
- Yes, it is.

348
00:16:48,205 --> 00:16:49,193
Wait a minute.

349
00:16:49,289 --> 00:16:50,691
You're that lame army guy.

350
00:16:50,786 --> 00:16:53,813
No, no, that's some other guy.
And he was a kick-ass fighter pilot.

351
00:16:53,909 --> 00:16:55,215
I cannot believe I gave you my number.

352
00:16:55,310 --> 00:16:56,362
Yeah, well, you did. Thanks.

353
00:16:56,457 --> 00:16:57,413
Yeah, well, give it back.

354
00:16:57,509 --> 00:17:00,695
Well, I don't think so. I earned it.
Fair and square. I'm calling you.

355
00:17:00,791 --> 00:17:02,990
But I'm never gonna go out with you.

356
00:17:03,085 --> 00:17:07,549
But how will you know it's me?
I'm a master of disguise.

357
00:17:07,672 --> 00:17:09,362
Yeah.

358
00:17:12,547 --> 00:17:13,854
Nice.

359
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:16,881
Come on, Ted. Victoria's Secret party.
Now. Let's go.

360
00:17:16,976 --> 00:17:19,898
- I'm staying.
- Fine. Fine.

361
00:17:20,863 --> 00:17:21,915
What are you doing?

362
00:17:22,010 --> 00:17:23,920
I'm flippering you off.

363
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:29,817
Sweetie, I'm so sorry.

364
00:17:29,912 --> 00:17:31,091
Seriously, it's not a big deal.

365
00:17:31,187 --> 00:17:34,851
He wanted to be a 'we'
and I wanted to be an 'I.'

366
00:17:34,946 --> 00:17:36,856
Dudes are such chicks.

367
00:17:38,674 --> 00:17:40,363
You guys, I'm fine.

368
00:17:40,459 --> 00:17:43,135
Ladies and gentlemen, the results are in.

369
00:17:43,231 --> 00:17:46,767
And the winners
of this year's costume contest are

370
00:17:46,862 --> 00:17:48,616
Lily Aldrin as a parrot,

371
00:17:48,711 --> 00:17:50,463
and Marshall Eriksen as a gay pirate.

372
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:52,757
Oh, yeah! Wait, what did he say?

373
00:17:52,852 --> 00:17:54,254
Oh, who cares, Marshall? We won.

374
00:17:54,350 --> 00:17:57,186
Wait. Gay pirate?
Where are you getting that from?

375
00:17:57,281 --> 00:17:58,811
Dude, you're wearing eyeliner.

376
00:17:58,907 --> 00:18:02,570
Okay, I just want everybody here to know
I'm not a gay pirate.

377
00:18:02,666 --> 00:18:04,418
I have sex with my parrot all the time.

378
00:18:04,514 --> 00:18:06,423
That came out wrong.

379
00:18:07,095 --> 00:18:09,773
Oh, yeah, doesn't matter! We won!

380
00:18:09,803 --> 00:18:13,308
- I love you, Marshmallow.
- I love you, too, Lilypad.

381
00:18:13,404 --> 00:18:15,920
You guys, let me get a picture.

382
00:18:29,807 --> 00:18:31,273
I had a feeling I'd find you here.

383
00:18:31,369 --> 00:18:33,278
Oh, hey.

384
00:18:33,376 --> 00:18:36,291
If you're here for The Shagarats,
you just missed the fourth encore.

385
00:18:36,387 --> 00:18:36,977
If you're here for The Shagarats,
you just missed the fourth encore.

386
00:18:37,072 --> 00:18:39,588
I never played any team sports.

387
00:18:40,386 --> 00:18:41,978
Are we playing I Never,
'cause there's nothing left...

388
00:18:42,074 --> 00:18:43,984
but peach schnapps.

389
00:18:44,942 --> 00:18:46,471
I played tennis in high school.

390
00:18:46,567 --> 00:18:47,618
You know why?

391
00:18:47,714 --> 00:18:52,716
Because it was just me out there.
I couldn't even stand playing doubles.

392
00:18:52,812 --> 00:18:54,722
I just got dumped.

393
00:18:54,723 --> 00:18:56,633
Oh, man, that sucks.

394
00:18:56,667 --> 00:18:59,437
It's okay. I wasn't that into him.

395
00:19:00,013 --> 00:19:01,223
Story of my life.

396
00:19:01,319 --> 00:19:03,295
Everyone else is off falling in love...

397
00:19:03,390 --> 00:19:08,137
and acting stupid and goofy
and sweet and insane, but not me.

398
00:19:08,232 --> 00:19:09,858
Why don't I want that more?

399
00:19:09,953 --> 00:19:11,863
I want to want that.

400
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:15,123
- Am I wired wrong or something?
- No.

401
00:19:15,561 --> 00:19:20,913
Look, you didn't want to be with me,
so clearly, you have abysmal taste in men.

402
00:19:21,009 --> 00:19:23,200
But you're wired just fine.

403
00:19:23,717 --> 00:19:27,085
Well, what if I'm just a cold person.

404
00:19:27,987 --> 00:19:31,141
Tonight, Mike was willing
to look like a complete idiot for me,

405
00:19:31,237 --> 00:19:33,266
but I couldn't be Gretel.

406
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:35,315
Why can't I be Gretel?

407
00:19:35,411 --> 00:19:38,119
Because you just haven't met
the right Hansel yet.

408
00:19:38,214 --> 00:19:39,458
Hey, one day you're gonna meet a guy...

409
00:19:39,553 --> 00:19:42,452
who's gonna make you wanna look
like a complete idiot.

410
00:19:42,548 --> 00:19:45,224
- Really?
- Yeah, he's out there somewhere.

411
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:46,849
Just like the slutty pumpkin.

412
00:19:49,908 --> 00:19:51,856
How do you do this, Ted?

413
00:19:52,042 --> 00:19:55,069
How do you sit out here all night
on the roof, in the cold,

414
00:19:55,165 --> 00:19:57,969
and still have faith
your pumpkin's gonna show up?

415
00:19:58,065 --> 00:19:59,974
Well, I'm pretty drunk.

416
00:20:02,398 --> 00:20:04,756
Look, I know that odds are,
the love of my life...

417
00:20:04,851 --> 00:20:07,814
isn't gonna magically walk
through that door in a pumpkin costume...

418
00:20:07,910 --> 00:20:10,452
at 2:43 in the morning.

419
00:20:12,052 --> 00:20:17,409
But it seems as nice a spot as any
to just, you know, sit and wait.

420
00:20:28,461 --> 00:20:30,371
Scooch.
