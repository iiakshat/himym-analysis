00:00:13,069 --> 00:00:15,791
Kids, this is
a Thanksgiving story.

3
00:00:15,887 --> 00:00:18,899
<i>Thanksgiving in New York
is a wonderful time.</i>

4
00:00:18,995 --> 00:00:22,966
<i>It's a time for giving of yourself,
for thinking of your fellow man.</i>

5
00:00:23,062 --> 00:00:26,554
<i>A time when the unforgiving city
becomes a little kinder.</i>

6
00:00:26,650 --> 00:00:28,570
Well, I just ralphed.

7
00:00:28,988 --> 00:00:32,800
- How much did you guys drink last night?
- Not how much, what.

8
00:00:32,896 --> 00:00:34,593
The Thanks-tini,

9
00:00:34,689 --> 00:00:37,476
a fun and delicious new novelty drink
I invented.

10
00:00:37,572 --> 00:00:41,652
Cranberry juice, potato vodka,
and a bouillon cube.

11
00:00:41,737 --> 00:00:44,429
Tastes just like a turkey dinner.

12
00:00:45,676 --> 00:00:48,532
It's like Thanksgiving in my mouth.

13
00:00:48,687 --> 00:00:51,314
You want a good holiday drink?
Try his Kwanzaa-politan.

14
00:00:53,299 --> 00:00:55,219
The shuttle's here!

15
00:00:56,151 --> 00:00:58,360
He hasn't been back home to Minnesota
since Christmas.

16
00:00:58,456 --> 00:01:00,603
- He's a little excited.
- Baby, we're holding up the shuttle.

17
00:01:00,699 --> 00:01:03,774
Do you have everything you need?
Toothbrush, pajamas, underpants?

18
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:05,790
Underpants.

19
00:01:06,913 --> 00:01:09,785
So, Lil, Marshall's family.

20
00:01:10,084 --> 00:01:12,839
Whole weekend with the future in-laws.
You excited?

21
00:01:12,935 --> 00:01:17,749
- Yeah, no, it'll be fun.
- Lily, you just said, 'Yeah, no.'

22
00:01:18,027 --> 00:01:21,064
Did I? No, I love Marshall's family.

23
00:01:21,775 --> 00:01:24,306
- But, yeah, no, it'll be great.
- You just did it again.

24
00:01:24,402 --> 00:01:26,322
Yeah, no, shut up.

25
00:01:27,349 --> 00:01:29,014
Wait, so you're not going home
for Thanksgiving?

26
00:01:29,110 --> 00:01:31,865
- No, I have to work on Friday. You?
- I'm Canadian, remember?

27
00:01:31,961 --> 00:01:34,684
- We celebrate Thanksgiving in October.
- Oh, right, I forgot.

28
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:38,592
You guys are weird.
You pronounce the word 'out,' 'oute.'

29
00:01:38,688 --> 00:01:40,770
You guys are the world's leader
in handgun violence,

30
00:01:40,866 --> 00:01:42,275
your healthcare system is bankrupt,

31
00:01:42,371 --> 00:01:47,240
and your country is deeply divided
on almost every important issue.

32
00:01:47,336 --> 00:01:49,784
Your cops are called Mounties.

33
00:01:51,852 --> 00:01:53,646
So, probably hanging out
with Barney, then?

34
00:01:53,742 --> 00:01:56,112
No. Barney's got
his own Thanksgiving tradition.

35
00:01:56,208 --> 00:01:58,643
Thanksgiving in a strip club. Who's in?

36
00:01:58,739 --> 00:02:01,782
The Lusty Leopard has
a surprisingly good Thanksgiving buffet.

37
00:02:01,878 --> 00:02:04,665
Plus, they do this thing.
Heather dresses up as a Pilgrim,

38
00:02:04,761 --> 00:02:09,373
and Misty dresses up as an Indian,
and they share a meal together.

39
00:02:09,469 --> 00:02:13,914
- Oh, Barney.
- I'm sorry. Native American.

40
00:02:15,331 --> 00:02:17,957
I think I'm gonna go to a homeless shelter,
serve food.

41
00:02:18,053 --> 00:02:19,623
- That's awesome.
- Yeah.

42
00:02:19,719 --> 00:02:22,987
I thought I'd just spend the day
giving back, you know, doing some good.

43
00:02:23,083 --> 00:02:25,197
- Canceling out Barney.
- Exactly.

44
00:02:25,293 --> 00:02:27,919
- Where are all my underpants?
- Did you check your suitcase?

45
00:02:28,015 --> 00:02:29,935
No.

46
00:02:30,258 --> 00:02:30,754
Let's go.

47
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:31,411
Let's go.

48
00:02:31,506 --> 00:02:33,109
<i>And go they went.</i>

49
00:02:33,205 --> 00:02:36,600
<i>All the way to St. Cloud, Minnesota,
Marshall's hometown.</i>

50
00:02:36,696 --> 00:02:39,579
<i>And as Lily stepped into
her fiancé's boyhood home,</i>

51
00:02:39,675 --> 00:02:41,244
<i>she received a big welcome.</i>

52
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:43,006
Hello! We're home!

53
00:02:45,697 --> 00:02:47,106
<i>A very big welcome.</i>

54
00:02:47,202 --> 00:02:50,918
<i>You see, at 6-foot-4,
Marshall was the runt of the Eriksen clan.</i>

55
00:02:51,014 --> 00:02:53,870
- Great to see you.
- Hey, you, too.

56
00:02:53,929 --> 00:02:56,899
Wow, I forgot how tall you guys are.

57
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:59,662
- Where's my almost daughter-in-law?
- Here I am!

58
00:02:59,758 --> 00:03:01,678
Over here!

59
00:03:03,025 --> 00:03:05,107
Well, you got yourself
a great little bride here, Son.

60
00:03:05,203 --> 00:03:06,197
- Yeah.
- That's great.

61
00:03:06,293 --> 00:03:08,439
All right, now, no farting around.

62
00:03:08,535 --> 00:03:11,225
Put your skates and your pads on, boys.
Game on in five minutes.

63
00:03:11,321 --> 00:03:12,378
Yeah. All right.

64
00:03:12,474 --> 00:03:14,941
- Oh, you gonna play hockey?
- Hike, hut!

65
00:03:15,037 --> 00:03:18,176
- With a basketball?
- Well, it's a combination of the two.

66
00:03:18,272 --> 00:03:21,059
- We call it 'bask-ice-ball.'
- We invented it.

67
00:03:21,155 --> 00:03:23,653
It's the most dangerous
and awesome sport in the world.

68
00:03:23,749 --> 00:03:27,331
Bask-ice-ball? Not ice-ket-ball?

69
00:03:27,433 --> 00:03:29,353
'Ice-ket-ball'?

70
00:03:29,996 --> 00:03:32,199
- Just sounds weird.
- Yeah.

71
00:03:32,238 --> 00:03:36,274
- It's bask-ice-ball, okay? And I'm the best.
- Oh, you wish.

72
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:39,605
Oh, well, maybe that's just 'cause
you haven't seen me play.

73
00:03:41,687 --> 00:03:44,057
I don't know, honey.
It's not really a sport for a girl.

74
00:03:44,153 --> 00:03:46,812
Well, that's funny,
'cause your brother throws like a girl.

75
00:03:49,439 --> 00:03:51,359
Marcus.

76
00:03:52,097 --> 00:03:55,204
- This is gonna be great.
- I know. I'm so psyched we did this.

77
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:56,422
Man, look at all these people.

78
00:03:56,518 --> 00:03:59,112
Giving up their Thanksgiving to help
their fellow man.

79
00:03:59,208 --> 00:04:02,283
These have gotta be the best people
in New York.

80
00:04:02,379 --> 00:04:05,099
Excuse me, guys, coming through.

81
00:04:05,198 --> 00:04:07,721
- Barney?
- Well, hi, guys.

82
00:04:07,889 --> 00:04:11,764
- What are you doing here?
- Oh, just the Lord's work.

83
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:14,679
- But you're Satan.
- Guys, okay, look.

84
00:04:14,775 --> 00:04:17,177
I don't advertise it, but I volunteer here.

85
00:04:17,273 --> 00:04:19,739
I think it's important to help
the less fortunate.

86
00:04:19,835 --> 00:04:23,507
I'm the Angelina Jolie
of incredibly hot guys.

87
00:04:23,583 --> 00:04:26,242
This is a joke, right?
You don't actually volunteer here?

88
00:04:26,338 --> 00:04:29,285
Barney, we need you out front.
There is a logjam on the stuffing line.

89
00:04:29,381 --> 00:04:31,464
- Can you show them how it's done?
- I'm on it.

90
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:35,083
- Wait, so, this is real? Barney does this?
- Every Sunday, all year long.

91
00:04:35,179 --> 00:04:36,140
He's our best volunteer.

92
00:04:36,236 --> 00:04:38,734
That's 'cause
I was trained by the best, Kendall.

93
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:41,105
Anyway, we're psyched to be here, Kendall.

94
00:04:41,201 --> 00:04:42,706
What do you need us to do?

95
00:04:42,802 --> 00:04:45,013
- Go home, we're full.
- What?

96
00:04:45,109 --> 00:04:46,902
We're volunteers, we're unpaid help.

97
00:04:46,998 --> 00:04:48,824
Can you ever really have
enough unpaid help?

98
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:52,508
On the biggest volunteer day of the year?
Yeah, you can.

99
00:04:52,604 --> 00:04:56,863
- Come on, we just wanna help out.
- Kendall. They're cool.

100
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:59,074
Fine. But I'm not promising anything.

101
00:04:59,170 --> 00:05:02,761
Wait here,
we'll let you know if we need you.

102
00:05:03,046 --> 00:05:06,185
Okay, well, I better get back out there.
There's a lot of food to give out.

103
00:05:06,281 --> 00:05:08,201
And a lot of smiles.

104
00:05:10,701 --> 00:05:12,678
I almost forgot.

105
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:14,385
I know it's early,

106
00:05:14,481 --> 00:05:18,609
but you are a future Mrs. Eriksen.

107
00:05:18,709 --> 00:05:21,166
Oh, thank you.

108
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:24,089
Well, it'll go great with my...

109
00:05:24,315 --> 00:05:26,235
I just love it.

110
00:05:26,685 --> 00:05:28,895
Okay, Lily, we're putting you on salad duty.

111
00:05:28,991 --> 00:05:32,098
Oh, I make this
great frisée and endive salad...

112
00:05:32,194 --> 00:05:34,969
with a coriander lime vinaigrette.

113
00:05:35,141 --> 00:05:37,752
But this is an American holiday.

114
00:05:38,312 --> 00:05:42,229
Lily, now that you're going to be
a Mrs. Eriksen,

115
00:05:42,444 --> 00:05:45,953
I'm going to let you in on a secret recipe:

116
00:05:46,096 --> 00:05:49,645
The Eriksen Family Seven Layer Salad.

117
00:05:50,548 --> 00:05:52,468
Seven layer salad?

118
00:05:54,519 --> 00:05:57,210
Six cups of mayonnaise?
That can't be right.

119
00:05:57,306 --> 00:06:01,386
Oh, no, dear. Sixteen cups.
Mayo's in that cabinet.

120
00:06:04,577 --> 00:06:08,357
Oh, my God, there is some
serious bask-ice-ball going on out there.

121
00:06:08,453 --> 00:06:11,272
Dad totally nailed Marcus in the face
with a snowball, which is a foul,

122
00:06:11,368 --> 00:06:13,066
'cause you only get
one snowball per possession,

123
00:06:13,162 --> 00:06:16,301
so I nailed him in the shin with my skate,
and then I totally dunked it.

124
00:06:16,397 --> 00:06:19,664
Yeah, you were sitting pretty,
till I whacked you with that mallet.

125
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:21,680
Hey, gorgeous.

126
00:06:21,762 --> 00:06:23,236
You having fun?

127
00:06:23,332 --> 00:06:27,367
Yeah, but I kind of miss you.
Could you stay in here for a little bit?

128
00:06:27,463 --> 00:06:29,770
Yeah, yeah, yeah, no problem.
It's halftime.

129
00:06:29,866 --> 00:06:32,140
Halftime's over.
Get your butts out here. Come on.

130
00:06:32,236 --> 00:06:35,908
And I hope you like the taste
of skate, dorko.

131
00:06:36,945 --> 00:06:39,533
- Go.
- Thanks, baby.

132
00:06:41,012 --> 00:06:42,070
Isn't this great?

133
00:06:42,166 --> 00:06:45,497
Can't you see why everybody
from my high school stays in this town?

134
00:06:45,593 --> 00:06:48,612
Hey, Marvin! You're the dorko, dorko!

135
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:55,651
Man, it's amazing out there.

136
00:06:55,747 --> 00:07:00,103
I've done so much good today,
I've got, like, a soul boner.

137
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:02,519
Man, the way
the faces of the less fortunate light up...

138
00:07:02,615 --> 00:07:03,992
when you give them a hot, nutritious meal,

139
00:07:04,088 --> 00:07:05,914
is there a better feeling on earth?

140
00:07:06,010 --> 00:07:09,566
Yesterday, you said the best feeling
on earth was getting your toes sucked.

141
00:07:09,662 --> 00:07:13,415
Then you requested a high-five,
with your foot.

142
00:07:13,851 --> 00:07:16,285
Hey, Barn, what do you say
you let us sub in for you...

143
00:07:16,381 --> 00:07:18,368
scoop stuffing for a little bit?

144
00:07:18,464 --> 00:07:20,194
You wanna scoop stuffing
your first day out?

145
00:07:20,290 --> 00:07:24,369
Hello, NFL,
can I be quarterback this Sunday? Dude.

146
00:07:26,791 --> 00:07:30,475
Okay, I finished the Gummi Bear layer
of the salad.

147
00:07:30,571 --> 00:07:32,491
What's next?

148
00:07:32,878 --> 00:07:34,836
Potato chips, of course.

149
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:39,156
So, Lily, when are you gonna start
thinking about having a baby?

150
00:07:39,252 --> 00:07:43,169
Baby? You know,
I hadn't really thought about it.

151
00:07:43,448 --> 00:07:44,632
At all.

152
00:07:44,728 --> 00:07:47,868
<i>Actually, Aunt Lily was lying.
It was all she'd been thinking about.</i>

153
00:07:47,964 --> 00:07:49,758
<i>You see, remember when she said...</i>

154
00:07:49,854 --> 00:07:51,774
Well, I just ralphed.

155
00:07:52,224 --> 00:07:54,402
<i>At that point, she was five days late.</i>

156
00:07:54,498 --> 00:07:56,418
<i>This was day six.</i>

157
00:07:57,029 --> 00:07:59,815
Yeah, I mean, I'm way too young
to have a baby, right?

158
00:07:59,911 --> 00:08:01,449
Oh, are you kidding?

159
00:08:01,545 --> 00:08:03,179
I was younger than you when I had Marcus.

160
00:08:03,275 --> 00:08:05,546
Beautiful 15-pound boy.

161
00:08:06,382 --> 00:08:09,890
Not much bigger
than this turkey right here.

162
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:14,900
Oh, boy.

163
00:08:20,188 --> 00:08:23,423
<i>Now, if Lily was already
uneasy about joining the Eriksen family,</i>

164
00:08:23,519 --> 00:08:24,480
<i>imagine how she felt...</i>

165
00:08:24,576 --> 00:08:29,157
<i>about possibly having a 15-pound Eriksen
growing inside of her.</i>

166
00:08:29,253 --> 00:08:31,211
That's a big baby, Judy.

167
00:08:31,559 --> 00:08:35,965
- The doctor thought he was twins.
- Twins.

168
00:08:36,011 --> 00:08:37,931
Twins.

169
00:08:40,111 --> 00:08:43,315
This is crazy. When did it get so hard
to do charity work?

170
00:08:43,411 --> 00:08:45,108
I do charity work all the time.

171
00:08:45,204 --> 00:08:47,254
Remember when I said
I'd find you a girlfriend?

172
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:50,233
Delightful. How's that little project
coming along, anyway?

173
00:08:50,329 --> 00:08:51,354
I'm working on it.

174
00:08:51,450 --> 00:08:53,917
I'm gonna introduce you to that girl
you've been staring at.

175
00:08:54,013 --> 00:08:56,095
What? That's crazy.
I haven't been staring at any girl.

176
00:08:56,191 --> 00:08:57,856
Have you met Ted?

177
00:08:57,952 --> 00:09:02,114
Hi, I'm the aforementioned Ted,
and this is... Gone.

178
00:09:02,598 --> 00:09:04,135
- I'm Amanda.
- Hi.

179
00:09:04,231 --> 00:09:10,060
- So, what do you do here, Ted?
- Well, I've been... Nothing. I do nothing.

180
00:09:10,156 --> 00:09:11,182
Well, if you wanna do something,

181
00:09:11,278 --> 00:09:13,488
you and your girlfriend can help
sort through these donations.

182
00:09:13,584 --> 00:09:15,601
Oh, I'm not his girlfriend.

183
00:09:15,697 --> 00:09:19,093
I used to be,
but I just wasn't enough woman for Ted,

184
00:09:19,189 --> 00:09:21,744
emotionally, or sexually.

185
00:09:22,296 --> 00:09:23,930
Oh, my God.

186
00:09:24,026 --> 00:09:27,772
So, Amanda, what do you need us to do?

187
00:09:28,414 --> 00:09:29,535
Okay, this is important.

188
00:09:29,631 --> 00:09:31,522
Go through all these boxes
of food donations,

189
00:09:31,618 --> 00:09:33,988
take out the really good stuff,
and put it into this box.

190
00:09:34,084 --> 00:09:36,287
Got it. Consider it sorted.

191
00:09:37,415 --> 00:09:38,408
Hey, we're in business.

192
00:09:38,504 --> 00:09:42,340
Hey, Barney's not gonna get
all the glory today.

193
00:09:45,198 --> 00:09:48,054
- Let's start with this one.
- Yeah.

194
00:09:48,241 --> 00:09:50,447
- Amen.
- Amen.

195
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:52,886
Look who came to say good night.

196
00:09:52,982 --> 00:09:56,001
It's little Martin. Three months old.

197
00:09:56,410 --> 00:09:59,965
- Months? Three months?
- He's been drinking his milk.

198
00:10:00,061 --> 00:10:01,086
Oh, yeah.

199
00:10:01,182 --> 00:10:03,102
Hear, hear.

200
00:10:04,417 --> 00:10:06,339
And she's already pregnant again.

201
00:10:06,435 --> 00:10:09,414
Well, that's 'cause
those Eriksen boys' boys can swim.

202
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:13,263
They got two tails and a drill bit for a head.

203
00:10:13,322 --> 00:10:17,198
- Dad, you're embarrassing me.
- Don't worry about it, Son, she's cool.

204
00:10:17,294 --> 00:10:20,881
- She's gonna be an Eriksen.
- Yeah, well, not literally.

205
00:10:20,977 --> 00:10:24,078
'Cause, you know, I'm keeping my name.

206
00:10:24,277 --> 00:10:26,221
But the apron?

207
00:10:29,177 --> 00:10:31,771
Well, we haven't actually decided
anything yet, so we're gonna...

208
00:10:31,867 --> 00:10:35,231
No, I've decided,
and I'm keeping my own name.

209
00:10:35,327 --> 00:10:38,079
But Eriksen is a great last name.

210
00:10:38,979 --> 00:10:41,019
People know the Eriksens.

211
00:10:42,502 --> 00:10:44,392
Well, sure, in St. Cloud,

212
00:10:44,488 --> 00:10:47,596
but our kids aren't gonna be
growing up in St. Cloud.

213
00:10:47,692 --> 00:10:49,611
Right, baby?

214
00:10:51,503 --> 00:10:54,706
Well, why not St. Cloud?
I mean, I loved growing up in St. Cloud.

215
00:10:54,802 --> 00:10:57,428
St. Cloud is a great place
to have a childhood.

216
00:10:57,524 --> 00:10:59,094
Well, so is New York.

217
00:11:01,785 --> 00:11:04,380
What? It is. And we grew up just fine.

218
00:11:04,476 --> 00:11:08,637
And we grew to the proper size,
and then we stopped.

219
00:11:13,829 --> 00:11:16,230
- Hey, Amanda, what's this box for?
- Oh, that's for me.

220
00:11:16,326 --> 00:11:20,619
- You can put it in my car.
- In your car. Then you'll take it...

221
00:11:20,715 --> 00:11:24,303
Home. Yeah, we get so much extra food,
no one can eat it all.

222
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:27,369
Oh, truffle oil. Score.

223
00:11:28,114 --> 00:11:31,542
But people donated this food
thinking it was going to feed the hungry.

224
00:11:31,638 --> 00:11:34,096
I know. And I'm starving.

225
00:11:37,404 --> 00:11:41,239
- But, Marshall, you love New York.
- Yes, I do.

226
00:11:41,471 --> 00:11:42,849
But you always said that when we had kids,

227
00:11:42,945 --> 00:11:47,301
- you wanted to move out of Manhattan.
- Well, yeah, to Brooklyn.

228
00:11:47,397 --> 00:11:51,272
Why are we even talking about this?
This is, like, way down the road.

229
00:11:51,368 --> 00:11:56,430
<i>But Lily knew 'way down the
road,'might not be so far down the road.</i>

230
00:11:56,526 --> 00:12:00,210
- I need to go to the restroom.
- Lily, the restroom's the other way.

231
00:12:00,306 --> 00:12:02,672
<i>So, she headed down the road.</i>

232
00:12:02,772 --> 00:12:05,393
Lily? Lily!

233
00:12:08,905 --> 00:12:11,755
So, wait. Not only have you not done
any good for anyone today,

234
00:12:11,851 --> 00:12:14,414
you're actually helping someone
steal from the homeless?

235
00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:17,649
You know, Ted, it's called
Thanksgiving, not Thanks-taking.

236
00:12:17,745 --> 00:12:19,346
Damn.

237
00:12:19,442 --> 00:12:21,493
Barney, you need me to sign
your time sheet, right?

238
00:12:21,589 --> 00:12:25,097
- Oh, yeah, right. Thanks.
- Barney.

239
00:12:25,368 --> 00:12:27,803
- Yeah, what's up?
- You have a time sheet?

240
00:12:27,899 --> 00:12:30,141
- No one else has a time sheet.
- Yeah, so?

241
00:12:30,237 --> 00:12:31,358
All right, let me see that. Come on.

242
00:12:31,454 --> 00:12:33,345
Hey, that's my private, personal business.

243
00:12:33,441 --> 00:12:36,067
'Court-mandated community service?'

244
00:12:36,163 --> 00:12:40,080
Oh, my God, you're on probation?
What did you do?

245
00:12:40,359 --> 00:12:43,378
That's my private, personal business.

246
00:12:48,751 --> 00:12:53,524
I was unfairly punished because
the wall belonged to the judge's church.

247
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:55,540
You peed on a church?

248
00:12:55,638 --> 00:12:58,168
I peed in an alley,
which happened to have a church,

249
00:12:58,264 --> 00:13:01,610
which I did not see, because I was drunk.

250
00:13:01,884 --> 00:13:06,045
- You are evil.
- All is right with the world again.

251
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:07,073
Okay, fine.

252
00:13:07,169 --> 00:13:10,244
So a judge is making me do this,
but I'm still doing it.

253
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:12,830
And kicking ass at it, BTW.

254
00:13:14,376 --> 00:13:19,108
When's the last time
either of you did something good, huh?

255
00:13:20,366 --> 00:13:22,286
Kendall. Kendall.

256
00:13:22,511 --> 00:13:27,407
Amanda is stealing Portobello mushrooms
from homeless people.

257
00:13:27,541 --> 00:13:31,539
Amanda. I called dibs
on the Portobello mushrooms.

258
00:13:32,729 --> 00:13:36,541
- Those are for the hungry.
- I know. And I'm starving.

259
00:13:42,243 --> 00:13:43,716
Those are good mushrooms!

260
00:13:43,812 --> 00:13:46,663
Mushrooms! Mushrooms!
Portobello mushrooms for everyone!

261
00:13:46,759 --> 00:13:50,105
Take them and run!
They're very expensive!

262
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:57,842
- Happy Thanksgiving.
- Happy Thanksgiving?

263
00:13:57,938 --> 00:14:00,469
As in, 'Check out the chick buying
the knock-up test, everybody,

264
00:14:00,565 --> 00:14:02,359
'wonder what must be going
through her head.'

265
00:14:02,455 --> 00:14:06,395
Yeah, well, since you asked,
a family of mayonnaise-guzzling giants...

266
00:14:06,491 --> 00:14:09,309
is trying to suck me
into their suburban nightmare,

267
00:14:09,405 --> 00:14:11,679
and there's a solid chance
that I have an Eriksen,

268
00:14:11,775 --> 00:14:15,937
the size of a 15-pound turkey,
growing inside of me!

269
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:20,817
You know the Eriksens?
You're Marshall's fiancée.

270
00:14:21,865 --> 00:14:24,300
- Fantastic.
- So nice to meet you.

271
00:14:24,396 --> 00:14:26,762
You're taller than described.

272
00:14:27,791 --> 00:14:30,514
Oh, I'm sorry I just yelled at you.

273
00:14:30,610 --> 00:14:33,620
- You mind if I use your bathroom?
- Don't have one.

274
00:14:33,716 --> 00:14:36,696
- So what do you do when you have to...
- I hold it.

275
00:14:42,433 --> 00:14:46,276
- You can't fire a volunteer.
- Apparently you can.

276
00:14:46,372 --> 00:14:49,511
And his two
non-mushroom-throwing friends.

277
00:14:49,607 --> 00:14:52,586
I can't believe I told Kendall
you guys were cool.

278
00:14:52,682 --> 00:14:55,245
I have 40 hours left
on my community service.

279
00:14:55,341 --> 00:15:00,530
And now I've gotta spend it
spearing trash on a freaking median strip.

280
00:15:00,626 --> 00:15:03,531
Volunteer of the Year!

281
00:15:04,597 --> 00:15:06,327
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Okay?

282
00:15:06,423 --> 00:15:08,666
Look, if there's anything I can do
to make it up to you,

283
00:15:08,762 --> 00:15:13,086
- just tell me, I'll do it.
- Ted, I'm glad you asked.

284
00:15:20,229 --> 00:15:23,208
- Surprisingly good.
- Right? I told you so.

285
00:15:23,304 --> 00:15:27,148
Public urination.
Who gets arrested for public urination?

286
00:15:27,244 --> 00:15:30,834
- Lily's been arrested.
- Oh, dear. What for?

287
00:15:31,792 --> 00:15:33,712
Public urination.

288
00:15:42,605 --> 00:15:45,543
- Thanks, Pete.
- No problemo, Marsh.

289
00:15:46,706 --> 00:15:48,625
- You all right?
- No.

290
00:15:49,204 --> 00:15:51,766
I embarrassed myself
in front of your family,

291
00:15:51,862 --> 00:15:58,309
and now I'm celebrating Thanksgiving in
probably the most depressing place ever.

292
00:16:00,351 --> 00:16:02,209
Well, I'm glad that you're safe.

293
00:16:02,305 --> 00:16:03,298
Hey, weird question.

294
00:16:03,394 --> 00:16:05,476
Why did you drive 3 miles down Route 23...

295
00:16:05,572 --> 00:16:07,366
and take a pee
behind a convenience store?

296
00:16:07,462 --> 00:16:09,448
Okay, I'll tell you, but before I do,

297
00:16:09,544 --> 00:16:12,940
promise me that we are not gonna move
to St. Cloud, Minnesota. Promise.

298
00:16:13,036 --> 00:16:14,989
Look it, I'm not suggesting
that we move here tomorrow,

299
00:16:15,085 --> 00:16:16,206
- I'm just...
- Just promise!

300
00:16:16,302 --> 00:16:17,840
Why do you want me to promise you that?

301
00:16:17,936 --> 00:16:20,594
Because I don't fit in here.
I'm not 8 feet tall,

302
00:16:20,690 --> 00:16:24,790
and I don't think you can call it a salad
if it has Funyuns in it!

303
00:16:24,886 --> 00:16:26,552
I'm Funyuns.

304
00:16:26,648 --> 00:16:30,877
And mayonnaise, and Gummi Bears,
and bask-ice-ball, and I love St. Cloud.

305
00:16:30,973 --> 00:16:33,663
And yes, there is a part of me
that would like to move here someday.

306
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:38,372
And why are we having this discussion
in a jail cell on Thanksgiving?

307
00:16:38,468 --> 00:16:42,662
Okay, personal effects.
One wallet, one cell phone,

308
00:16:43,561 --> 00:16:45,481
one pregnancy test.

309
00:16:53,074 --> 00:16:56,583
Pete arrested me before I could look at it.

310
00:17:03,196 --> 00:17:05,303
- Whoa.
- Yeah.

311
00:17:07,007 --> 00:17:09,635
Lily, we can't let our kids play bask-ice-ball.

312
00:17:09,731 --> 00:17:12,505
Bask-ice-ball is really dangerous.

313
00:17:13,350 --> 00:17:15,272
Yeah, what are the rules
to that game, anyway?

314
00:17:15,368 --> 00:17:19,203
There are no rules.
We just whale on each other.

315
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:26,471
Look, I don't wanna be
exactly like my family.

316
00:17:27,155 --> 00:17:29,929
And don't take this the wrong way,

317
00:17:30,069 --> 00:17:34,394
but I don't wanna be
exactly like your family, either.

318
00:17:34,746 --> 00:17:36,705
We'll be our own family.

319
00:17:36,764 --> 00:17:42,476
And we'll find our own way to
freak out the people our kids bring home.

320
00:17:44,836 --> 00:17:46,756
Great, now I'm crying.

321
00:17:47,014 --> 00:17:50,505
Look, we may have some really
big decisions to make...

322
00:17:50,601 --> 00:17:52,521
in about 10 seconds,

323
00:17:52,908 --> 00:17:55,247
but right now,
I don't care where our kids grow up,

324
00:17:55,343 --> 00:17:58,443
as long as they have you for a father.

325
00:18:01,621 --> 00:18:03,478
Gosh, I hope you're the father.

326
00:18:03,574 --> 00:18:07,002
Just a little joke to lighten up the mood.

327
00:18:11,358 --> 00:18:13,278
What does it say?

328
00:18:13,792 --> 00:18:17,301
- I'm afraid to look.
- It's negative!

329
00:18:17,988 --> 00:18:19,965
Oh, thank God.

330
00:18:21,255 --> 00:18:23,175
And, hey!

331
00:18:25,067 --> 00:18:27,458
Ted, are you listening?

332
00:18:28,623 --> 00:18:29,872
You're a good guy.

333
00:18:29,968 --> 00:18:31,858
Wanna know why I have to work tomorrow?

334
00:18:31,954 --> 00:18:35,093
My firm's designing an executive lounge
for a tobacco company.

335
00:18:35,189 --> 00:18:38,616
In the fight against cancer,
I'm on the side of cancer.

336
00:18:38,712 --> 00:18:41,563
Okay, Ted. I found a way
for you to help someone, to do some good.

337
00:18:41,659 --> 00:18:44,030
This is Walter. Walter is homeless.

338
00:18:44,126 --> 00:18:47,713
- And Walter would like a lap dance.
- Are you joking?

339
00:18:47,809 --> 00:18:52,326
I never joke about the sublime art
of burlesque entertainment.

340
00:18:52,422 --> 00:18:54,120
No, Barney, that's insane.

341
00:18:54,216 --> 00:18:57,611
Sir, would you like me to buy you
a ticket to the buffet?

342
00:18:57,707 --> 00:19:01,230
No, I'm stuffed.
Just the lap dance would be fine.

343
00:19:01,326 --> 00:19:03,184
Ted, Walter's been to three shelter dinners.

344
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:07,686
You know where he hasn't been?
To heaven with Samantha.

345
00:19:08,565 --> 00:19:11,576
Look, it's the one chance you've had
all day to help someone in need.

346
00:19:11,672 --> 00:19:14,120
Now, buy this man a lap dance.

347
00:19:14,652 --> 00:19:18,047
You said you wanted to see the look of joy
in someone's eyes.

348
00:19:18,143 --> 00:19:21,407
You know, I don't think I'm gonna watch.

349
00:19:22,306 --> 00:19:25,855
Here you go, Walter. Happy Thanksgiving.

350
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:30,585
Thank you so much. No, really. Thank you.

351
00:19:34,158 --> 00:19:36,198
Happy Thanksgiving, guys.

352
00:19:38,578 --> 00:19:41,189
Thanksgiving in November. Weird.

353
00:19:47,473 --> 00:19:49,972
<i>So, that was Thanksgiving 2005.</i>

354
00:19:50,068 --> 00:19:54,008
<i>To be honest, it didn't go great.
But life has plenty of good parts.</i>

355
00:19:54,104 --> 00:20:00,305
<i>It's the rough parts that make you thankful
you have people to share it with.</i>

356
00:20:15,244 --> 00:20:19,895
Hey, I saw what you did for that guy.
It was really sweet.

357
00:20:20,401 --> 00:20:23,257
- Do you want a dance?
- No, thanks.

358
00:20:23,669 --> 00:20:26,688
- Do you want some yams?
- No, thanks.

359
00:20:27,192 --> 00:20:29,136
- I'm Amber.
- I'm Ted.

360
00:20:30,043 --> 00:20:32,249
Actually, I'm Tracey.

361
00:20:33,726 --> 00:20:35,232
Still Ted.

362
00:20:35,328 --> 00:20:38,627
<i>And that, kids,
is the true story of how I met your mother.</i>

363
00:20:38,723 --> 00:20:40,709
- What?
- I'm kidding.
