2
00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:15,901
- Okay, where was I?
- You were telling us how you met Mom.

3
00:00:15,997 --> 00:00:18,308
- In excruciating detail.
- Right.

4
00:00:18,404 --> 00:00:23,249
So, back in 2005, when I was 27,
my two best friends got engaged.

5
00:00:23,345 --> 00:00:25,817
<i>And it got me thinking,
maybe I should get married.</i>

6
00:00:25,913 --> 00:00:29,567
<i>And then I saw Robin. She was incredible.</i>

7
00:00:29,667 --> 00:00:32,973
<i>I just knew I had to meet her.
That's where your Uncle Barney came in.</i>

8
00:00:33,069 --> 00:00:36,341
I suggest we play a little game
I like to call, 'Have you met Ted?'

9
00:00:36,437 --> 00:00:38,459
No, no, no, no, we're not playing
'Have you met Ted.'

10
00:00:38,555 --> 00:00:40,478
Hi, have you met Ted?

11
00:00:41,347 --> 00:00:43,978
<i>So I asked her out,
and I know this sounds crazy,</i>

12
00:00:44,074 --> 00:00:46,417
<i>but after just one date
I was in love with her,</i>

13
00:00:46,513 --> 00:00:48,375
<i>which made me say something stupid.</i>

14
00:00:48,471 --> 00:00:49,690
I think I'm in love with you.

15
00:00:49,786 --> 00:00:50,716
What?

16
00:00:50,812 --> 00:00:53,788
- Oh, Dad.
- So then what happened?

17
00:00:54,856 --> 00:00:56,043
<i>Nothing.</i>

18
00:00:56,139 --> 00:00:58,513
<i>I mean, I'd made a complete fool of myself.</i>

19
00:00:58,610 --> 00:01:01,305
<i>So, a week went by
and I decided not to call her.</i>

20
00:01:01,401 --> 00:01:02,877
So, you're not gonna call her?

21
00:01:02,974 --> 00:01:04,546
You went from 'I think I'm in love with you'

22
00:01:04,642 --> 00:01:05,765
to 'I'm not gonna call her'?

23
00:01:05,861 --> 00:01:07,177
I wasn't in love with her, okay?

24
00:01:07,273 --> 00:01:10,418
I was briefly in love with
the abstract concept of getting married.

25
00:01:10,514 --> 00:01:13,050
It had absolutely nothing to do with Robin.

26
00:01:13,146 --> 00:01:14,237
- Robin?
- Hey.

27
00:01:14,333 --> 00:01:15,681
Look who I ran into.

28
00:01:15,777 --> 00:01:17,189
Since when do you guys know each other?

29
00:01:17,285 --> 00:01:19,208
Oh, since about here.

30
00:01:20,044 --> 00:01:22,355
Lily recognized me from the news...

31
00:01:22,451 --> 00:01:25,721
- Hello, sailor.
- They just got engaged.

32
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:30,411
Well, I should get back to the station.
See you guys.

33
00:01:31,262 --> 00:01:33,123
- Nice seeing you, Ted.
- Yeah, you, too.

34
00:01:33,219 --> 00:01:35,142
Thanks.

35
00:01:35,690 --> 00:01:36,781
- Damn it!
- What?

36
00:01:36,877 --> 00:01:39,166
- I'm in love with her.
- No.

37
00:01:39,637 --> 00:01:41,915
As your sponsor, I will not let you relapse.

38
00:01:42,011 --> 00:01:44,386
- You blew it. It's over. Move on.
- I don't know.

39
00:01:44,482 --> 00:01:47,530
I just have this feeling she's the future
Mrs. Ted Mosby.

40
00:01:49,231 --> 00:01:50,836
Lily, you squeaked?

41
00:01:50,932 --> 00:01:54,012
She said something about me, didn't she?
Come on, spill it, Red.

42
00:01:54,108 --> 00:01:55,328
Fine.

43
00:01:55,424 --> 00:01:57,713
So, what do we think of Ted?

44
00:01:58,986 --> 00:02:00,558
Ted's something else.

45
00:02:00,654 --> 00:02:01,713
Huh?

46
00:02:01,809 --> 00:02:03,125
I'm gonna spin that as good.

47
00:02:03,221 --> 00:02:05,789
Lots of guys are something,
I'm something else.

48
00:02:05,885 --> 00:02:07,328
He comes on a little strong.

49
00:02:07,424 --> 00:02:09,732
But that's part of my charm.

50
00:02:09,831 --> 00:02:12,206
- But that's part of his charm.
- Oh, totally.

51
00:02:12,302 --> 00:02:15,125
I mean, he's sweet, he's charming,
he's just looking for something...

52
00:02:15,222 --> 00:02:16,891
a little bit more serious than I am.

53
00:02:16,987 --> 00:02:20,324
I mean, the most I can handle right now
is something casual.

54
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:23,244
- This just stays between us, right?
- Are you kidding?

55
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:25,484
This flapper, Fort Knox.

56
00:02:26,357 --> 00:02:27,992
Oops.

57
00:02:28,089 --> 00:02:29,565
She wants casual?

58
00:02:29,661 --> 00:02:31,641
Okay, I'll be casual.

59
00:02:31,747 --> 00:02:34,538
I'm gonna be a mushroom cloud of casual.

60
00:02:34,635 --> 00:02:36,849
You know why? 'Cause it's a game.

61
00:02:36,946 --> 00:02:39,608
I wanted to skip to the end
and do the whole happily-ever-after thing,

62
00:02:39,705 --> 00:02:42,112
but you don't get there
unless you play the game.

63
00:02:42,208 --> 00:02:44,743
- So you gonna ask her out?
- Yeah. No!

64
00:02:44,839 --> 00:02:48,625
I can't ask her out, because if I ask her out
I'm asking her out.

65
00:02:48,721 --> 00:02:52,481
So how do I ask her out
without asking her out?

66
00:02:55,749 --> 00:02:57,672
Did you guys get high?

67
00:02:58,027 --> 00:03:00,479
I got it. I don't ask her out.

68
00:03:00,498 --> 00:03:03,604
I invite her to our party next Friday.

69
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:06,242
- We're having a party next Friday?
- We are now.

70
00:03:06,338 --> 00:03:07,332
Casual.

71
00:03:07,428 --> 00:03:09,803
Yeah, 'cause nothing says 'casual'
like inviting a hundred people...

72
00:03:09,899 --> 00:03:14,640
over just to mack on one girl.
Oh, and Lily, that's my leg.

73
00:03:15,065 --> 00:03:18,335
You waited five minutes to tell me that?

74
00:03:18,723 --> 00:03:21,803
- All right, so call her up.
- No, calling's not casual.

75
00:03:21,899 --> 00:03:23,697
I just got to bump into her somewhere.

76
00:03:23,793 --> 00:03:26,777
Now, if only I knew her schedule,
I could arrange a chance encounter.

77
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:31,532
That's great, Ted.
You'll be the most casual stalker ever.

78
00:03:32,758 --> 00:03:35,230
<i>Now, ever since Marshall
put that ring on her finger,</i>

79
00:03:35,326 --> 00:03:38,980
<i>Lily had been, well, extra affectionate.</i>

80
00:03:39,626 --> 00:03:41,549
Baby, no.

81
00:03:41,583 --> 00:03:44,568
I have a 25-page paper
on constitutional law due Monday.

82
00:03:44,664 --> 00:03:46,011
I've barely started.

83
00:03:46,107 --> 00:03:49,622
Hey, I'm just sitting here wearing my ring.

84
00:03:50,183 --> 00:03:52,106
My beautiful ring.

85
00:03:53,295 --> 00:03:56,696
Kind of makes wearing other stuff
seem wrong.

86
00:03:56,792 --> 00:03:58,494
My shirt.

87
00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:01,941
Kind of don't wanna wear
my shirt anymore.

88
00:04:02,119 --> 00:04:04,066
Or my underwear.

89
00:04:04,686 --> 00:04:07,465
That's right. I'm not wearing any.

90
00:04:09,852 --> 00:04:12,827
- No underwear?
- Not even slightly.

91
00:04:12,933 --> 00:04:14,856
Guys.

92
00:04:15,435 --> 00:04:17,358
Boundaries.

93
00:04:18,387 --> 00:04:20,185
<i>- There she is.
- Thanks, Bill.</i>

94
00:04:20,281 --> 00:04:22,623
<i>I'm reporting from
the Razzle Dazzle Supermarket...</i>

95
00:04:22,719 --> 00:04:24,764
<i>on 75th and Columbus...</i>

96
00:04:24,901 --> 00:04:26,914
75th and Columbus.

97
00:04:27,757 --> 00:04:29,008
Game on!

98
00:04:29,104 --> 00:04:30,741
Where four-year-old Leroy Ellenberg...

99
00:04:30,837 --> 00:04:35,578
has climbed inside a Grab-A-Prize machine
and gotten stuck.

100
00:04:37,832 --> 00:04:41,169
And all in the pursuit
of a stuffed, purple giraffe.

101
00:04:41,265 --> 00:04:44,347
For Metro News 1, I'm Robin Scherbatsky.

102
00:04:44,443 --> 00:04:47,684
- We're clear.
- Thanks, Don.

103
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:49,108
Ted?

104
00:04:49,282 --> 00:04:52,779
- Robin? Wow, what are the odds?
- What are you doing here?

105
00:04:52,876 --> 00:04:56,333
Oh, you know, just shopping for dip.

106
00:04:56,438 --> 00:04:59,325
I love dip. No, I don't love dip. I like dip.

107
00:04:59,422 --> 00:05:01,434
As a friend, you know.

108
00:05:01,539 --> 00:05:04,010
So, hey, you reporting a news story
or something?

109
00:05:04,106 --> 00:05:07,636
Yeah, a kid stuck in a crane machine.
How sweet of you to call it news.

110
00:05:07,732 --> 00:05:10,358
Wow, kid in a crane machine.

111
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:12,192
You just had to have that toy, didn't you?

112
00:05:12,289 --> 00:05:13,861
Couldn't play the game like everyone else.

113
00:05:13,957 --> 00:05:15,880
You're all sweaty.

114
00:05:16,043 --> 00:05:17,711
Cute kid.

115
00:05:17,808 --> 00:05:19,509
You know, it's so funny
I should run into you.

116
00:05:19,605 --> 00:05:22,140
We're having a party next Friday
if you feel like swinging by,

117
00:05:22,236 --> 00:05:24,001
but, you know, whatever.

118
00:05:24,097 --> 00:05:26,343
Oh, I'm going back home next weekend.

119
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:29,551
- It's too bad it's not tonight.
- It is. It's tonight.

120
00:05:29,648 --> 00:05:31,990
This Friday. Did I say next Friday?
Yeah, sorry.

121
00:05:32,086 --> 00:05:33,851
I guess I've been saying
'next Friday' all week.

122
00:05:33,947 --> 00:05:36,098
But, yeah, it's tonight. The party's tonight.

123
00:05:36,194 --> 00:05:38,469
But, you know, whatever.

124
00:05:43,959 --> 00:05:46,526
- Hello?
- Hey, am I interrupting anything?

125
00:05:46,622 --> 00:05:49,927
No, no, I'm just writing my paper,
hitting the books.

126
00:05:50,023 --> 00:05:53,040
Yeah, well, you and Lily
might want to put some clothes on.

127
00:05:53,136 --> 00:05:56,896
We're throwing a party in two hours.
Okay, bye.

128
00:06:01,383 --> 00:06:03,629
So, Gatsby, what are you gonna do
when Robin shows up?

129
00:06:03,635 --> 00:06:06,169
Okay, I got it all planned out.

130
00:06:06,972 --> 00:06:09,732
<i>She steps through the door.
And where is Ted?</i>

131
00:06:09,828 --> 00:06:12,074
<i>Not eagerly waiting by the door.</i>

132
00:06:12,170 --> 00:06:14,224
<i>No, I'm across the room
at my drafting table...</i>

133
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:17,914
<i>showing some foxy young thing
all my cool architecture stuff.</i>

134
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:21,637
<i>So, Robin strolls over,
and I casually give her one of these,</i>

135
00:06:21,733 --> 00:06:23,656
<i>'Hey, what's up?'</i>

136
00:06:23,914 --> 00:06:27,572
<i>She says,
'Hey, nice place, etcetera, etcetera.'</i>

137
00:06:27,668 --> 00:06:29,144
<i>And then I say,</i>

138
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,781
<i>'Well, make yourself at home.'</i>

139
00:06:30,877 --> 00:06:33,701
<i>And I casually return to my conversation.</i>

140
00:06:33,797 --> 00:06:36,007
<i>Then, an hour later,</i>

141
00:06:36,588 --> 00:06:39,083
<i>'Oh, you're still here?'</i>

142
00:06:39,188 --> 00:06:42,525
<i>I say, like I don't really care
but it's a nice surprise.</i>

143
00:06:42,621 --> 00:06:44,583
<i>And then, very casually,</i>

144
00:06:44,932 --> 00:06:46,855
<i>'Wanna see the roof?'</i>

145
00:06:48,269 --> 00:06:49,359
- The roof.
- The roof.

146
00:06:49,456 --> 00:06:51,863
I get her up to the roof
and the roof takes care of the rest.

147
00:06:51,959 --> 00:06:53,274
What's so special about the roof?

148
00:06:53,370 --> 00:06:56,595
Oh, the moon, the stars,
the shimmering skyline.

149
00:06:56,753 --> 00:07:00,023
You can't not fall in love on that roof.

150
00:07:00,315 --> 00:07:02,401
We do it up there sometimes.

151
00:07:02,497 --> 00:07:05,128
- Solid plan, my little friends.
- We're the same height.

152
00:07:05,224 --> 00:07:08,658
But may I suggest one little modification?

153
00:07:09,107 --> 00:07:10,679
<i>That foxy young thing
you were chatting up?</i>

154
00:07:10,775 --> 00:07:12,380
<i>Take her up to the roof
and have sex with her.</i>

155
00:07:12,476 --> 00:07:14,466
<i>- Crazy, monkey-style...
- That's not the plan.</i>

156
00:07:14,562 --> 00:07:17,354
<i>It should be the plan. I mean, look at her.
Ted, look at her.</i>

157
00:07:17,450 --> 00:07:19,739
<i>- She's smoking.
- Thank you.</i>

158
00:07:19,985 --> 00:07:21,974
<i>- Yeah.
- But she's not Robin.</i>

159
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:23,290
Exactly.

160
00:07:23,386 --> 00:07:24,862
Ted, let's rap.

161
00:07:24,958 --> 00:07:25,889
Statistic.

162
00:07:25,985 --> 00:07:27,653
At every New York party
there's always a girl...

163
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:29,386
who has no idea whose party she's at.

164
00:07:29,482 --> 00:07:32,466
She knows no one you know
and you will never see her again.

165
00:07:32,563 --> 00:07:36,698
Do you see where I'm going, huh,
with this?

166
00:07:36,799 --> 00:07:38,338
Barney, I don't think so.

167
00:07:38,435 --> 00:07:42,701
- Scoping, bip, scoping, bip.
- Man, you're a dork.

168
00:07:42,799 --> 00:07:45,462
Bip, bip, bip, bip. Target acquired!

169
00:07:45,559 --> 00:07:47,805
And now it's time we play a little game
I like to call,

170
00:07:47,901 --> 00:07:50,244
- 'Have you met Ted?'
- Oh, come on, not this.

171
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:52,136
- Hi, have you met Ted?
- No.

172
00:07:52,233 --> 00:07:53,291
- Hi.
- Hi.

173
00:07:53,387 --> 00:07:55,281
- You know Marshall, Lily?
- No.

174
00:07:55,377 --> 00:07:58,875
- Do you know anyone at this party?
- I work with Carlos.

175
00:07:58,971 --> 00:08:01,587
Excuse me. Anyone know a Carlos?

176
00:08:01,635 --> 00:08:02,565
- No.
- No.

177
00:08:02,661 --> 00:08:06,151
<i>On a silver platter. Bon appétit.</i>

178
00:08:06,544 --> 00:08:08,180
I don't think so.

179
00:08:08,276 --> 00:08:11,871
Your loss, her gain.
Excuse me, can I show you the roof?

180
00:08:11,967 --> 00:08:13,571
- It's magical up there.
- Sure.

181
00:08:13,667 --> 00:08:15,432
Wait, wait, wait.
Hey, I got that roof reserved.

182
00:08:15,528 --> 00:08:19,942
- Dude, Robin's not coming.
- Hey, she's gonna show up.

183
00:08:21,978 --> 00:08:23,486
She'll show up.

184
00:08:23,582 --> 00:08:26,034
<i>She didn't show up.</i>

185
00:08:26,117 --> 00:08:28,524
At least, it was a great party.

186
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:31,399
I ate like four whole cans of dip.

187
00:08:31,508 --> 00:08:34,300
You always know what to say, old friend.

188
00:08:37,862 --> 00:08:39,722
- It's Robin.
- Answer it.

189
00:08:39,819 --> 00:08:43,660
No, no, no, not right away.
I gotta seem casual.

190
00:08:44,214 --> 00:08:46,878
- Hello?
- I'm so sorry I missed your party.

191
00:08:46,974 --> 00:08:49,600
- Who is this? Meredith?
- Robin.

192
00:08:49,829 --> 00:08:51,178
Oh, Robin.

193
00:08:51,274 --> 00:08:53,070
Hey, yeah,

194
00:08:53,166 --> 00:08:55,895
- I guess you never showed up, did you?
- No, I got stuck at work.

195
00:08:55,991 --> 00:08:58,365
But they finally got that kid
out of the crane machine.

196
00:08:58,461 --> 00:09:02,504
- Did he get to keep the purple giraffe?
- Yeah, they let him keep all the toys.

197
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:06,804
He was in there a long time
and little kids have small bladders.

198
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:09,352
I wish your party was tonight.

199
00:09:10,687 --> 00:09:12,894
It is. The party's tonight.

200
00:09:13,093 --> 00:09:17,834
Yeah, it's a two-day party,
'cause that's just how we roll.

201
00:09:18,388 --> 00:09:21,468
So if you wanna swing by,
you know, it's casual.

202
00:09:21,564 --> 00:09:23,488
See you.

203
00:09:26,313 --> 00:09:28,559
- So that was Robin.
- What are you doing to me, man?

204
00:09:28,656 --> 00:09:31,383
- I got a paper to write.
- I know, I'm sorry. It's terrible.

205
00:09:31,479 --> 00:09:34,504
- I'll buy more dip.
- Ted, Ted, wait!

206
00:09:35,009 --> 00:09:36,933
Get French Onion!

207
00:09:40,752 --> 00:09:44,676
Can you believe this guy?
I got a paper to write.

208
00:09:44,764 --> 00:09:47,844
Okay, fine.
But it's gotta be, like, super quick.

209
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:52,354
- And no cuddling after.
- I'm the luckiest girl alive.

210
00:09:57,727 --> 00:09:59,844
Oh, you were so right about the roof.

211
00:10:00,422 --> 00:10:04,122
The roof!
The roof is on fire, Ted!

212
00:10:04,739 --> 00:10:06,762
That girl from last night,
I took her back to my place,

213
00:10:06,858 --> 00:10:09,168
then this morning took her outside,
spun her around a couple times...

214
00:10:09,176 --> 00:10:10,107
and sent her walking.

215
00:10:10,203 --> 00:10:13,829
She will never find her way back
and there she is.

216
00:10:13,925 --> 00:10:16,492
- How did she get here? Did you invite her?
- I have no idea who that is.

217
00:10:16,589 --> 00:10:18,129
She said she works with Carlos.
Who's Carlos?

218
00:10:18,225 --> 00:10:19,155
I don't know any Carlos.

219
00:10:20,279 --> 00:10:24,064
- Hi, you. You're back.
- I sure am.

220
00:10:26,568 --> 00:10:30,611
- Come on, sweetie, I need a drink.
- Sweetie. Really?

221
00:10:30,707 --> 00:10:32,630
Help.

222
00:10:33,081 --> 00:10:34,718
Whoa, whoa, rabbits.

223
00:10:34,814 --> 00:10:36,900
Come on, I got that roof reserved.

224
00:10:36,996 --> 00:10:38,919
All right.

225
00:10:39,178 --> 00:10:42,354
So, it's over between me
and Works with Carlos Girl.

226
00:10:42,451 --> 00:10:44,473
- Oh, that was fast.
- Yeah.

227
00:10:44,569 --> 00:10:46,526
I was trying to think,
what's the quickest way...

228
00:10:46,622 --> 00:10:49,093
to get rid of a girl you just met?

229
00:10:49,189 --> 00:10:51,532
- I think I'm in love with you.
- What?

230
00:10:51,628 --> 00:10:54,407
- Thanks, bro.
- Glad I could help.

231
00:10:55,992 --> 00:10:58,495
What the... No, no, no, no, come on.

232
00:10:58,591 --> 00:11:00,515
Sorry, Ted.

233
00:11:01,287 --> 00:11:04,175
Great. What am I gonna do
when Robin shows up?

234
00:11:04,271 --> 00:11:05,971
She'll show up.

235
00:11:06,067 --> 00:11:08,186
<i>She didn't show up.</i>

236
00:11:08,282 --> 00:11:12,369
All right, we threw two parties,
everybody had fun,

237
00:11:12,517 --> 00:11:15,623
everybody Wang-ed, everybody Chung-ed.

238
00:11:15,822 --> 00:11:19,159
Now the kid has got to get to work.
And the kid is not to be disturbed.

239
00:11:19,255 --> 00:11:22,432
Repeat after me,
'I will not have sex with Marshall.'

240
00:11:22,528 --> 00:11:25,384
- I will not have sex with Marshall.
- I will not have sex with Marshall.

241
00:11:28,208 --> 00:11:30,131
It's Robin.

242
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:32,572
- Hello?
- Hi, Ted.

243
00:11:32,668 --> 00:11:36,936
Amanda? Oh, Denise, sorry.
You totally sounded like Amanda.

244
00:11:37,032 --> 00:11:39,075
- It's Robin.
- Oh, Robin.

245
00:11:39,214 --> 00:11:41,556
<i>- Hi.
- I totally wanted to come.</i>

246
00:11:41,653 --> 00:11:44,444
I got stuck at work again.
I feel like I live there.

247
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:46,305
Sorry I missed your party, again.

248
00:11:46,401 --> 00:11:49,450
<i>Hey, ain't no thing, but a chicken wing,
mamacita.</i>

249
00:11:49,546 --> 00:11:51,469
Who am I?

250
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:55,771
I guess there's no chance your two-dayer
turned into a three-dayer?

251
00:11:55,867 --> 00:11:58,113
It did indeed. The party continues tonight.

252
00:11:58,210 --> 00:12:00,327
Yeah, last night people were, like,

253
00:12:00,423 --> 00:12:03,023
'Keep it going, bro! Party trifecta!'

254
00:12:03,119 --> 00:12:05,461
Wow, okay. Well, I'll be there.

255
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:07,481
Great. See you tonight.

256
00:12:10,435 --> 00:12:12,359
So that was Robin.

257
00:12:13,708 --> 00:12:18,650
<i>So I threw a third party
for Robin, on a Sunday night.</i>

258
00:12:18,746 --> 00:12:20,669
Oh, this is lame.

259
00:12:20,703 --> 00:12:23,076
Lame or casual?

260
00:12:23,687 --> 00:12:25,831
- Lame.
- Or casual?

261
00:12:27,281 --> 00:12:30,874
Hey, law books.
Ready for a little 15-minute recess?

262
00:12:30,971 --> 00:12:34,597
Sorry, baby, I gotta work.
I need all my blood up here.

263
00:12:34,693 --> 00:12:37,293
<i>Has anybody seen
An Introduction to Contract, Tort...</i>

264
00:12:37,389 --> 00:12:40,904
<i>and Restitution Statutes from 1865 to 1923?
</i>

265
00:12:42,459 --> 00:12:45,467
- Anybody seen a big-ass book?
- No.

266
00:12:46,341 --> 00:12:48,264
Hello, Barney.

267
00:12:48,523 --> 00:12:50,446
Of course.

268
00:12:51,587 --> 00:12:53,128
You look well.

269
00:12:53,224 --> 00:12:55,791
Is it weird they invited both of us?

270
00:12:55,887 --> 00:12:57,810
Who?

271
00:12:57,941 --> 00:13:01,701
Who invited you?
No one even knows who you are.

272
00:13:02,176 --> 00:13:06,754
I understand you're hurt,
but you don't have to be cruel.

273
00:13:07,021 --> 00:13:09,228
Carlos was right about you.

274
00:13:09,877 --> 00:13:11,890
Who is Carlos?

275
00:13:11,995 --> 00:13:14,049
Hey, where the hell is my...

276
00:13:14,145 --> 00:13:16,068
Oh!

277
00:13:18,188 --> 00:13:20,111
Okay.

278
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:23,386
<i>An Introduction to Contract,
Tort and Restitution Statutes...</i>

279
00:13:23,482 --> 00:13:25,626
<i>from 1865 to 1923...</i>

280
00:13:25,985 --> 00:13:27,686
is not a coaster!

281
00:13:27,782 --> 00:13:31,376
Ted, I'm jeopardizing my law career
so you can throw not one,

282
00:13:31,472 --> 00:13:34,874
not two, but three parties
for some girl that you just met...

283
00:13:34,970 --> 00:13:36,703
who's probably not even gonna show up!

284
00:13:36,799 --> 00:13:40,477
I mean, where is she, Ted, huh?
Where's Robin?

285
00:13:41,548 --> 00:13:43,976
Hi. Hi, Robin.

286
00:13:52,393 --> 00:13:55,581
So, you threw all these parties for me?

287
00:13:55,923 --> 00:13:58,457
No. Oh, you thought that... No.

288
00:13:58,907 --> 00:14:00,830
Okay, yes. You got me.

289
00:14:01,089 --> 00:14:04,972
One of the reasons I threw these parties
was so that I could introduce you...

290
00:14:05,068 --> 00:14:07,212
to this guy.

291
00:14:08,115 --> 00:14:10,426
I figured, you know,
since it didn't work out between us...

292
00:14:10,523 --> 00:14:11,999
and now we can just laugh about it.

293
00:14:13,154 --> 00:14:16,709
- Well, anyway, Robin, this is...
- Carlos.

294
00:14:22,431 --> 00:14:24,613
She's still talking to Carlos.

295
00:14:24,709 --> 00:14:26,603
I can still win this. It's not over.

296
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:29,523
Okay, buddy, time for the tough talk.

297
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:32,155
Robin seems great,
but let's look at the facts.

298
00:14:32,251 --> 00:14:33,662
You want to get married...

299
00:14:33,759 --> 00:14:37,930
and right now there's a million women
in New York looking for exactly you.

300
00:14:38,026 --> 00:14:39,438
But Robin ain't one of them.

301
00:14:39,534 --> 00:14:42,069
She's not just one of them. She's the one.

302
00:14:42,165 --> 00:14:45,926
Yeah well, 'the one'
is heading up to the roof.

303
00:14:47,781 --> 00:14:49,925
What are you gonna do?

304
00:14:50,027 --> 00:14:53,134
Nothing. It's a game. I gotta just...

305
00:14:53,235 --> 00:14:55,158
keep playing it.

306
00:15:32,222 --> 00:15:33,666
- Hey.
- Hey.

307
00:15:33,763 --> 00:15:37,613
<i>- Carlos, can you give us a minute?
- Hey, no sweat, hombre.</i>

308
00:15:37,709 --> 00:15:39,633
See you.

309
00:15:42,426 --> 00:15:46,244
Robin, look, I didn't throw this party
to set you up with Carlos...

310
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:50,100
or the one before that,
or the one before that.

311
00:15:50,208 --> 00:15:53,738
I threw these parties
because I wanted to see you.

312
00:15:53,834 --> 00:15:55,757
Well, here I am.

313
00:15:56,530 --> 00:15:59,963
There's something here.
Look, unless I'm crazy.

314
00:16:00,059 --> 00:16:01,982
You're not crazy.

315
00:16:03,396 --> 00:16:06,925
I don't know, Ted.
I mean, we barely know each other...

316
00:16:07,021 --> 00:16:09,717
and you're looking at me with that look
and it's like...

317
00:16:09,813 --> 00:16:12,765
- What, like what?
- It's like, 'Let's fall in love,

318
00:16:12,861 --> 00:16:16,039
'and get married and have kids
and drive them to soccer practice.'

319
00:16:16,135 --> 00:16:19,985
I'm not gonna force sports on them
unless they're interested.

320
00:16:20,082 --> 00:16:23,226
It's a great look,
but you're looking at the wrong girl.

321
00:16:23,322 --> 00:16:25,152
- No, I'm not.
- Yes, you are.

322
00:16:25,248 --> 00:16:27,622
I don't want to get married right now,
maybe ever.

323
00:16:27,718 --> 00:16:30,863
And if we go out together, I'd feel like

324
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:34,810
I'd either have to marry you
or break your heart...

325
00:16:34,906 --> 00:16:37,922
and I just couldn't do either of those things.

326
00:16:38,019 --> 00:16:41,779
Just like you can't turn off the way you feel.

327
00:16:43,794 --> 00:16:44,820
Click.

328
00:16:44,917 --> 00:16:46,840
Off. Let's make out.

329
00:16:46,939 --> 00:16:48,222
What?

330
00:16:48,318 --> 00:16:51,912
What? That was the off switch
and I turned it off.

331
00:16:52,008 --> 00:16:54,254
I mean, look, sure, yes, I wanna...

332
00:16:54,351 --> 00:16:58,138
fall in love, get married, blah, blah, blah.
But, on the other hand,

333
00:16:58,234 --> 00:17:00,696
you, me,

334
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,724
the roof.

335
00:17:03,232 --> 00:17:07,237
- There's no off switch.
- There is an off switch.

336
00:17:08,014 --> 00:17:09,554
And it's off.

337
00:17:09,650 --> 00:17:11,574
No, it's not.

338
00:17:11,928 --> 00:17:13,852
Yes, it is.

339
00:17:13,982 --> 00:17:15,994
- No, it's not.
- Yes,

340
00:17:17,126 --> 00:17:19,050
it is.

341
00:17:27,266 --> 00:17:29,189
Oh.

342
00:17:32,047 --> 00:17:33,971
No, it's not.

343
00:17:34,101 --> 00:17:37,043
You're right. There's no off switch.

344
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:41,626
- God, I wish there was an off switch.
- Me, too.

345
00:17:41,722 --> 00:17:46,544
- God, I wish there was an off switch.
- Me, too.

346
00:17:47,064 --> 00:17:48,987
So...

347
00:17:50,016 --> 00:17:51,939
What do we do now?

348
00:17:54,188 --> 00:17:56,111
We could be friends.

349
00:17:58,024 --> 00:18:01,843
Look, I know it sounds insincere
when people say that...

350
00:18:01,939 --> 00:18:04,149
but we could.

351
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:06,623
I don't know, Robin.

352
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,292
I made such a jackass of myself here,

353
00:18:08,388 --> 00:18:10,410
we start hanging out,
every time I see you, it'll be like,

354
00:18:10,507 --> 00:18:12,785
'Oh, that's right, I'm a jackass.'

355
00:18:12,881 --> 00:18:14,804
You're not a jackass.

356
00:18:14,838 --> 00:18:19,715
Look, I'm sorry. I only moved here in April,
and I'm always working.

357
00:18:19,812 --> 00:18:23,899
And I just haven't met
a lot of good people so far.

358
00:18:24,176 --> 00:18:26,099
But I understand.

359
00:18:26,935 --> 00:18:28,858
Well,

360
00:18:29,213 --> 00:18:32,839
maybe in a few months
after it's not so fresh we could all,

361
00:18:32,935 --> 00:18:35,758
you know, get a beer.

362
00:18:35,855 --> 00:18:38,732
Yeah. That sounds good.

363
00:18:40,508 --> 00:18:42,431
I'll see you, Ted.

364
00:18:46,957 --> 00:18:48,881
Or, you know, now.

365
00:18:52,445 --> 00:18:54,734
We could all get a beer now.

366
00:18:57,739 --> 00:18:59,662
I'd like that.

367
00:19:01,332 --> 00:19:06,319
My friends are gonna love you, like you,
you know as a friend.

368
00:19:06,698 --> 00:19:08,622
Jackass.

369
00:19:10,484 --> 00:19:12,408
Unbelievable.

370
00:19:12,506 --> 00:19:15,201
That's just a recipe for disaster.
They work together.

371
00:19:15,298 --> 00:19:17,191
- You jealous?
- Oh, please.

372
00:19:17,287 --> 00:19:20,432
- What does Carlos have that I don't?
- A date tonight?

373
00:19:21,619 --> 00:19:23,673
Stop the tape. Rewind, play it again.

374
00:19:23,769 --> 00:19:25,976
A date tonight?

375
00:19:26,591 --> 00:19:28,553
I'm not sure I like her.

376
00:19:28,806 --> 00:19:30,314
Hey, don't you have a paper to write?

377
00:19:30,410 --> 00:19:32,656
- Dude, you're talking to the kid.
- I know it.

378
00:19:32,753 --> 00:19:36,186
I'm gonna knock back this beer,
I'm gonna knock back one more beer,

379
00:19:36,282 --> 00:19:39,042
I'm gonna go home,
I'm gonna write a 25-page paper,

380
00:19:39,138 --> 00:19:41,287
I'm gonna hand it in
and I'm gonna get a 'A.'

381
00:19:41,384 --> 00:19:44,653
My name is Rufus and that's the Troofus.

382
00:19:45,106 --> 00:19:46,229
<i>He got a B-minus.</i>

383
00:19:46,326 --> 00:19:51,074
<i>But, still, 25 pages in one night, B-minus?
The kid was good.</i>

384
00:19:51,170 --> 00:19:54,315
At least, let me buy you a beer.
Come on, I'll buy everyone a beer.

385
00:19:54,411 --> 00:19:56,335
I'll help carry.

386
00:20:00,476 --> 00:20:01,888
- You know something, Ted?
- What?

387
00:20:01,984 --> 00:20:05,835
You are a catch.
You're gonna make some girl very happy.

388
00:20:05,931 --> 00:20:08,690
And I am going to help you find her.

389
00:20:08,786 --> 00:20:10,709
Well, good luck.

390
00:20:10,711 --> 00:20:12,638
I mean, maybe,
New York is just too big a town.

391
00:20:12,734 --> 00:20:14,659
I mean, there's millions of people
in this city.

392
00:20:14,755 --> 00:20:17,643
How, in all this mess, is a guy
supposed to find the love of his life?

393
00:20:17,739 --> 00:20:20,355
I mean, where do you even begin?

394
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:24,758
Hi, have you met Ted?
