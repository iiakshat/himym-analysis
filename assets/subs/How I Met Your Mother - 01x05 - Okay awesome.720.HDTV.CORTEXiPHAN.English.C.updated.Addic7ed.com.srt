2
00:00:12,590 --> 00:00:15,424
So, kids, would you like to
hear the story of the time I went deaf?

3
00:00:15,697 --> 00:00:17,742
- Why does he even ask?
- I know, he's just gonna tell us anyway.

4
00:00:18,673 --> 00:00:20,788
I sure am. It all began...

5
00:00:20,845 --> 00:00:23,113
<i>when Robin strolled into the bar and said...
</i>

6
00:00:23,208 --> 00:00:25,092
- Say you're my bitch.
- I'm your bitch.

7
00:00:25,188 --> 00:00:26,466
Why this time?

8
00:00:26,562 --> 00:00:30,646
Because tonight,
I am getting us all into Okay.

9
00:00:30,779 --> 00:00:32,694
Okay? Awesome!

10
00:00:32,823 --> 00:00:35,123
What's going on? Did I just have a stroke?

11
00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:36,496
Okay is the name of a club.

12
00:00:36,592 --> 00:00:38,637
Yeah, it's supposed to be
incredibly exclusive.

13
00:00:38,732 --> 00:00:41,383
This friend of mine once waited
outside for two hours, couldn't get in.

14
00:00:41,479 --> 00:00:43,396
A friend of yours named you?

15
00:00:43,492 --> 00:00:46,422
No, a friend of mine named, shut up!

16
00:00:46,654 --> 00:00:48,091
Yeah, well, the owner goes to my gym.

17
00:00:48,187 --> 00:00:51,222
It turns out that he is a fan
of my reporting for Metro News 1.

18
00:00:51,317 --> 00:00:54,385
- So now I'm on the list for tonight.
- Nice going, Scherbatsky.

19
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:57,387
You're becoming a long-and-difficult-
to-spell household name.

20
00:00:57,483 --> 00:00:59,272
He's even getting me into the VIP room.

21
00:00:59,368 --> 00:01:03,265
Yeah, he just wants to show you his
own VIP, if you know what I mean.

22
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:08,080
All right, what does VIP stand for
in your little universe?

23
00:01:08,088 --> 00:01:10,773
Well, I know that the P is Penis.

24
00:01:10,963 --> 00:01:14,413
Right, so you guys are in.
Should I invite Marshall and Lily?

25
00:01:14,509 --> 00:01:16,936
<i>Why was this funny?
I'll explain.</i>

26
00:01:17,032 --> 00:01:19,236
<i>You see, Lily was a kindergarten teacher.</i>

27
00:01:19,332 --> 00:01:21,815
<i>And so, one fateful naptime...</i>

28
00:01:21,919 --> 00:01:24,538
Austin and I spent Saturday night
at the most charming...

29
00:01:24,634 --> 00:01:27,285
little bed and breakfast. It was so nice.

30
00:01:27,381 --> 00:01:28,914
What did you do this weekend?

31
00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:32,365
- Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug!
- Chug! Come on! Chug! Chug!

32
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:35,902
- Ten seconds!
- Suck it, losers!

33
00:01:38,689 --> 00:01:41,699
You know, quiet time with the fiancÃ©.

34
00:01:42,522 --> 00:01:45,045
I don't know, I just felt embarrassed.

35
00:01:45,141 --> 00:01:49,614
Claire's my age, and she and her husband
do all this classy grown-up stuff.

36
00:01:49,709 --> 00:01:52,647
Maybe we should start doing
some grown-up stuff.

37
00:01:52,743 --> 00:01:54,884
That's some pretty grown-up stuff
we did this morning.

38
00:01:54,979 --> 00:01:58,356
Yeah, but it wasn't classy.

39
00:01:58,461 --> 00:02:00,793
Maybe we should have a winetasting party.

40
00:02:00,889 --> 00:02:03,252
I like wine. I like tasting.

41
00:02:03,636 --> 00:02:08,715
You know I can party. Let's do it.
Let's rock it. Maturity style!

42
00:02:08,811 --> 00:02:10,983
And ever since then, she's been
signing him up for book clubs,

43
00:02:11,079 --> 00:02:13,378
- cooking classes.
- All the things you do when you know...

44
00:02:13,474 --> 00:02:16,030
where your next thousand lays
are coming from.

45
00:02:16,126 --> 00:02:18,074
So, no, Lily and Marshall
will not be joining us.

46
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:20,821
Got it. Anyway, Ted, part two of my story.

47
00:02:20,917 --> 00:02:22,387
My friend Kelly's gonna be there.

48
00:02:22,732 --> 00:02:26,054
- Kelly, who supposedly I'm gonna love.
- Oh, you are gonna love Kelly.

49
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:28,642
She's fun, she's smart,
she lives in the moment.

50
00:02:28,738 --> 00:02:32,219
She's ugly, she's ugly,
she ugs in the ugly.

51
00:02:32,315 --> 00:02:35,163
- Oh, and she's totally hot.
- Okay.

52
00:02:35,222 --> 00:02:37,394
I guess I could take her off your hands
for an evening.

53
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:39,822
So, do you have any other
hot single friends?

54
00:02:39,917 --> 00:02:41,832
No. Kelly works in...

55
00:02:44,006 --> 00:02:46,370
- Oh, no, Ted! Your blazer.
- What? What? What?

56
00:02:46,465 --> 00:02:49,085
Somebody spilled gorgeous all over it.
Love it.

57
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:50,905
Thank you.

58
00:02:51,001 --> 00:02:53,035
And his hair was perfect.

59
00:02:53,685 --> 00:02:55,570
Hey, we're wearing the same shirt.

60
00:02:55,665 --> 00:02:59,019
Oh, wait, no, that's just my shirt
reflected in yours.

61
00:02:59,114 --> 00:03:01,766
One of the 24 similarities
between girls and fish...

62
00:03:01,862 --> 00:03:04,258
is that they're both attracted
to shiny objects.

63
00:03:04,354 --> 00:03:06,653
You really never read my blog, do you?

64
00:03:06,749 --> 00:03:08,379
All right, Tin Man. Let's hit it.

65
00:03:08,474 --> 00:03:11,158
All right, well,
have fun at your little disco, guys.

66
00:03:11,253 --> 00:03:14,288
- What the hell happened to these two?
- Marshall and I are just growing up.

67
00:03:14,384 --> 00:03:15,916
Yeah, it's gonna be sweet, too.

68
00:03:16,012 --> 00:03:17,930
Like tonight, we're tasting
all these different wines,

69
00:03:18,025 --> 00:03:21,443
pairing them up
with these cool gourmet cheeses.

70
00:03:21,539 --> 00:03:22,466
Wow!

71
00:03:22,561 --> 00:03:24,669
Who knew being in a committed
heterosexual relationship...

72
00:03:24,765 --> 00:03:26,718
could make a guy so gay.

73
00:03:27,767 --> 00:03:30,036
All right, cool kids are leaving now.

74
00:03:30,132 --> 00:03:32,736
Grandma, Grandpa, don't wait up.

75
00:03:42,365 --> 00:03:47,655
My, oh, my! There are some
ferocious looking cutlets here tonight.

76
00:03:47,828 --> 00:03:50,125
All right. Hook-up strategy:

77
00:03:50,351 --> 00:03:52,811
Find a cutlet, lock her in early,

78
00:03:52,907 --> 00:03:56,101
grind with her all night till she's mine.

79
00:03:56,197 --> 00:03:58,305
These strategies ever work for you?

80
00:03:58,401 --> 00:04:01,851
The question is, do these strategies
ever not work for me?

81
00:04:01,947 --> 00:04:05,527
Either way, the answer's
about half the time.

82
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:08,869
My bitches! Check this out.

83
00:04:09,229 --> 00:04:11,144
They're with me.

84
00:04:14,596 --> 00:04:16,510
We're her bitches, too.

85
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:19,705
We'll wait here.

86
00:04:20,281 --> 00:04:22,038
And with today's interest rate climate,

87
00:04:22,134 --> 00:04:24,274
you gotta go for the 30-year fixed mortgage.

88
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:26,127
- Oh, totally.
- Yeah.

89
00:04:26,222 --> 00:04:27,692
So, Marshall, what about you?

90
00:04:27,788 --> 00:04:29,481
You guys thinking house, baby?

91
00:04:31,365 --> 00:04:34,241
No, I think we're gonna wait
on the baby thing.

92
00:04:34,337 --> 00:04:36,540
I mean, I love babies. Babies rule.

93
00:04:36,636 --> 00:04:40,175
Pudgy arms and stuff.
But they make you old.

94
00:04:40,756 --> 00:04:43,504
Kind of like this anchor
weighing you down to one spot.

95
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,325
Forever.

96
00:04:45,421 --> 00:04:47,536
I'm three months pregnant.

97
00:04:48,359 --> 00:04:50,273
Not awkward, guys.

98
00:04:50,499 --> 00:04:53,754
Not awkward unless we let it be awkward.

99
00:04:58,708 --> 00:05:00,018
- This place seems great.
- Yeah.

100
00:05:00,114 --> 00:05:02,414
- Is Kelly here?
- Yeah, she's around somewhere.

101
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:03,948
Let's go find her. I'll introduce you guys.

102
00:05:04,043 --> 00:05:06,886
Then I should probably duck
into the VIP room.

103
00:05:06,981 --> 00:05:08,675
It's so stupid and arbitrary, isn't it?

104
00:05:08,771 --> 00:05:11,741
- Who gets to be a VIP and who doesn't.
- Can we come?

105
00:05:11,837 --> 00:05:13,841
It's not that arbitrary.

106
00:05:16,597 --> 00:05:19,631
- Whoa, this place is loud.
- You think?

107
00:06:05,652 --> 00:06:08,878
Think it was kind of weird
that Ted didn't invite me out with him?

108
00:06:08,974 --> 00:06:11,465
Why? You'd rather be out
at some dance club?

109
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:13,733
All noisy and sweaty with the...

110
00:06:15,777 --> 00:06:17,692
Is that what you want?

111
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:22,604
Is this what you want?
'30-year fixed mortgage.'

112
00:06:22,708 --> 00:06:26,533
'I'm three months pregnant.'

113
00:06:29,321 --> 00:06:31,235
That was awkward.

114
00:06:35,103 --> 00:06:38,041
- Let's start drinking.
- Not so fast.

115
00:06:38,137 --> 00:06:39,639
In order for the tannins to mellow,

116
00:06:39,734 --> 00:06:43,396
we should let it breathe
for about 30 minutes.

117
00:06:43,727 --> 00:06:45,642
Freaking tannins.

118
00:07:13,466 --> 00:07:15,380
Okay.

119
00:07:16,085 --> 00:07:17,810
You know what they're doing
in there right now?

120
00:07:17,906 --> 00:07:19,918
They're watching Claire's ultrasound video.

121
00:07:20,014 --> 00:07:22,984
And I swear to God,
even the baby looks bored.

122
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:24,838
Come on. It's not that bad.

123
00:07:24,933 --> 00:07:27,648
We're really starting to click
with these guys.

124
00:07:27,744 --> 00:07:30,268
Claire and Austin just invited us
to their fondue fest...

125
00:07:30,363 --> 00:07:31,546
next Saturday night.

126
00:07:31,641 --> 00:07:34,292
Are you honestly trying to get me
excited about fondue?

127
00:07:34,388 --> 00:07:38,619
It's dipping stuff in hot cheese.
What's not to love?

128
00:07:39,115 --> 00:07:41,129
Okay, that does sound good.

129
00:07:41,224 --> 00:07:45,473
But it's dipping stuff in hot cheese
with boring people.

130
00:07:45,569 --> 00:07:48,661
Marshall, it's time for us to grow up.

131
00:07:49,753 --> 00:07:51,286
<i>Marshall knew she was right.</i>

132
00:07:51,381 --> 00:07:54,067
<i>He had to stop acting like a kid.</i>

133
00:07:54,289 --> 00:07:56,204
<i>But not tonight.</i>

134
00:07:56,716 --> 00:07:59,272
<i>Now, our apartment was on the third floor.
</i>

135
00:07:59,367 --> 00:08:02,115
<i>So I'm not sure if this part is actually true.
</i>

136
00:08:02,211 --> 00:08:05,303
<i>But Uncle Marshall swears it happened.</i>

137
00:08:07,928 --> 00:08:09,842
Taxi!

138
00:08:52,903 --> 00:08:56,002
The new album is great.
It's all smooth and polished.

139
00:08:56,098 --> 00:08:57,599
Not all dark and heavy like the early stuff.

140
00:08:57,694 --> 00:09:01,682
Oh, yeah. Norah Jones
just gets better and better.

141
00:09:02,231 --> 00:09:04,435
Please tell me we can drink the wine now.

142
00:09:04,531 --> 00:09:08,459
Five more minutes.
We don't wanna rush those tannins.

143
00:09:08,555 --> 00:09:10,470
Freaking tannins.

144
00:09:35,515 --> 00:09:36,857
I'm wetting my pants!

145
00:09:40,658 --> 00:09:42,383
No, no, I was just saying that...

146
00:09:42,479 --> 00:09:45,481
<i>I think that's when I realized,
clubs weren't awesome.</i>

147
00:09:45,577 --> 00:09:49,182
<i>Clubs weren't even okay. Clubs sucked.</i>

148
00:09:50,496 --> 00:09:52,612
<i>I had to get out of there.</i>

149
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,606
- Hey, Robin!
- Hey!

150
00:09:55,701 --> 00:09:57,235
- Why aren't you inside?
- I'm calling the owner.

151
00:09:57,331 --> 00:10:00,142
There's a guy in there who won't
let me into the stupid VIP room.

152
00:10:00,237 --> 00:10:01,483
What are you doing here?

153
00:10:01,578 --> 00:10:04,199
Oh, I have this move.
So I came here to bust it.

154
00:10:04,294 --> 00:10:06,209
Can you get me in?

155
00:10:08,958 --> 00:10:10,171
Great, voicemail.

156
00:10:10,267 --> 00:10:11,801
- Thanks, I'll see you.
- Bye.

157
00:10:11,897 --> 00:10:13,717
Oh, come on! He just got here.

158
00:10:13,813 --> 00:10:16,272
- He's probably famous.
- Oh, yeah.

159
00:10:16,368 --> 00:10:18,253
Isn't there a third Affleck brother?

160
00:10:18,349 --> 00:10:20,872
Keith Affleck or Brian Affleck or something?

161
00:10:20,968 --> 00:10:24,061
Holy crap! We just saw Brian Affleck.

162
00:10:25,377 --> 00:10:28,283
And, it's not like I care so much
about getting into the VIP room.

163
00:10:28,379 --> 00:10:32,947
I have been in tons of VIP rooms.
Not exactly a VIP room virgin.

164
00:10:33,043 --> 00:10:35,321
But seriously, call me back.

165
00:10:37,930 --> 00:10:41,316
Oh, I was just in there. Robin Scherbatsky.
I'm on the list.

166
00:10:41,412 --> 00:10:43,680
Name's already crossed off. Sorry.

167
00:10:43,775 --> 00:10:47,800
But I'm Robin Scherbatsky.
I'm a reporter for Channel 1.

168
00:10:47,896 --> 00:10:50,988
There's a Channel 1? Back of the line.

169
00:10:51,953 --> 00:10:55,045
Should've snuck in with Brian Affleck.

170
00:11:27,537 --> 00:11:30,540
Coat wench, do not uncheck
that man's jacket!

171
00:11:30,635 --> 00:11:32,712
Sorry, I was just being dramatic.
You're not a wench.

172
00:11:32,808 --> 00:11:35,938
No, no, no, coat wench. I like it.
I should get a sign made up.

173
00:11:36,034 --> 00:11:38,525
Wait. What are you doing here?
Lily let you go?

174
00:11:38,621 --> 00:11:40,570
Lily? Who cares, right?

175
00:11:40,665 --> 00:11:42,071
- You are so dead.
- Oh, I'm so dead.

176
00:11:42,166 --> 00:11:44,083
- Well, I'm going home.
- No!

177
00:11:44,179 --> 00:11:46,958
I put my ass and probably other parts
of my body on the line...

178
00:11:47,054 --> 00:11:48,747
to come down here and party with my bro.

179
00:11:48,843 --> 00:11:51,494
- Now damn it, we're gonna party.
- All right. One beer.

180
00:11:51,589 --> 00:11:56,472
Yes. Finally I don't have
to wait a half an hour for a drink.

181
00:11:58,106 --> 00:11:59,640
Yeah!

182
00:11:59,735 --> 00:12:01,650
No tannins!

183
00:12:01,907 --> 00:12:04,015
<i>Oh, man. I can't believe
I forgot to tell you this.</i>

184
00:12:04,111 --> 00:12:05,485
<i>This is important to the story.</i>

185
00:12:05,581 --> 00:12:07,720
<i>Earlier that day,
Marshall went to the dentist...</i>

186
00:12:07,816 --> 00:12:09,797
<i>and got a temporary crown put in.</i>

187
00:12:09,892 --> 00:12:11,807
<i>Okay, so anyway...</i>

188
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:19,155
What?

189
00:12:19,667 --> 00:12:21,581
C'mon, let's go!

190
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:22,670
I'm staying!

191
00:12:22,766 --> 00:12:24,680
What?

192
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:32,315
Marshall, are you okay?

193
00:12:54,580 --> 00:13:00,276
<i>Again, I wasn't there,
so I'm a little foggy on the details.</i>

194
00:13:00,777 --> 00:13:02,692
Taxi!

195
00:13:06,043 --> 00:13:07,639
- Hey.
- Hey.

196
00:13:07,735 --> 00:13:10,196
Marshall just ditched out on our own party.

197
00:13:10,291 --> 00:13:12,208
Can you get me in there?
I kind of need to kill him.

198
00:13:12,304 --> 00:13:16,392
Actually, I can't even get myself in.
I was such a dork.

199
00:13:16,488 --> 00:13:20,385
I get recognized one time
and I start thinking I'm Julia Roberts.

200
00:13:20,481 --> 00:13:23,737
I'm no VIP. I'm not even an IP.

201
00:13:23,835 --> 00:13:28,391
I'm just a lowly little P
sitting out here in the gutter.

202
00:13:28,466 --> 00:13:29,680
You know something?

203
00:13:29,776 --> 00:13:34,088
I'd take a P in the gutter
over Julia Roberts any day.

204
00:13:38,593 --> 00:13:39,838
There's Barney.

205
00:13:39,934 --> 00:13:41,848
I'm leaving.

206
00:13:47,344 --> 00:13:48,431
Hey!

207
00:13:48,527 --> 00:13:50,092
Broke my tooth!

208
00:13:50,188 --> 00:13:53,085
Do you have any aspirin?

209
00:13:53,828 --> 00:13:58,457
Maybe there's a machine in the restroom.

210
00:14:05,616 --> 00:14:08,044
<i>Now, to this day, I don't know
what happened in there.</i>

211
00:14:08,139 --> 00:14:12,045
<i>But when Marshall came out
a few minutes later...</i>

212
00:14:21,234 --> 00:14:23,149
- Rough night?
- Yeah.

213
00:14:24,248 --> 00:14:28,592
These clubs are supposed to be fun, right?
Why do I hate them so much?

214
00:14:28,688 --> 00:14:33,320
Because all of the stuff
you're supposed to like, usually sucks.

215
00:14:33,416 --> 00:14:35,778
Like these clubs. Or cruises.

216
00:14:36,226 --> 00:14:40,310
- Or New Year's Eve.
- Or the Super Bowl.

217
00:14:40,507 --> 00:14:43,219
- Or parades.
- The Rockettes.

218
00:14:43,317 --> 00:14:46,192
- Or parades.
- You said that already.

219
00:14:46,288 --> 00:14:48,967
- I really hate parades.
- Okay.

220
00:14:49,898 --> 00:14:54,307
He just left in the middle of our own party.
You don't do that.

221
00:14:54,402 --> 00:14:56,957
Unless, of course,
you're chasing after somebody...

222
00:14:57,053 --> 00:15:00,886
who's already done it,
and then I think it's okay.

223
00:15:00,982 --> 00:15:04,017
Well, I hate to take his side.
But, come on, a winetasting?

224
00:15:04,112 --> 00:15:07,307
What's the big plan for next Saturday?
Scrabble night?

225
00:15:07,403 --> 00:15:09,317
Don't check your email.

226
00:15:09,830 --> 00:15:11,556
Why are you becoming this person?

227
00:15:11,651 --> 00:15:15,101
I heard that in college you flashed
a campus tour group on a dare.

228
00:15:15,196 --> 00:15:19,184
Once on a dare.
The other times were just for fun.

229
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:21,937
I'm not in college anymore.

230
00:15:22,033 --> 00:15:26,504
I'd love to go back and be that person
again, but you can't move backwards.

231
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:29,410
- You can only go forward.
- False.

232
00:15:29,795 --> 00:15:31,424
You can go wherever you want.

233
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:33,499
I guess, the question is,
where do you want to go?

234
00:15:33,595 --> 00:15:36,598
I want to go into this club
and find my fiancÃ©.

235
00:15:36,694 --> 00:15:40,876
- Well, that you can't do.
- You wanna bet?

236
00:15:41,677 --> 00:15:43,591
Follow my lead.

237
00:15:44,616 --> 00:15:46,530
Hey, big guy.

238
00:15:48,864 --> 00:15:50,397
I said, follow my lead.

239
00:15:50,493 --> 00:15:52,218
- Yes, please, please.
- Do it, do it.

240
00:15:52,314 --> 00:15:54,710
- Follow her lead.
- You have to. Follow it.

241
00:15:54,806 --> 00:15:56,720
Please.

242
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:05,345
Those were the four greatest
and only breasts I have ever seen.

243
00:16:08,157 --> 00:16:11,863
Yeah. See, if everyone keeps telling you
something is supposed to be fun,

244
00:16:11,959 --> 00:16:13,044
it's usually not.

245
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:14,195
- Right.
- Right.

246
00:16:14,291 --> 00:16:19,146
So by that logic, if you and I were to,
say, go out on a date...

247
00:16:19,241 --> 00:16:22,020
Well, then we couldn't go anywhere
that's supposed to be fun.

248
00:16:22,116 --> 00:16:24,152
Right. The DMV it is.

249
00:16:24,321 --> 00:16:26,684
- Then we'll get our teeth cleaned.
- Sounds awful. It's a date.

250
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:27,707
Okay.

251
00:16:27,803 --> 00:16:32,685
But there's still one big question
that needs to be answered.

252
00:16:33,392 --> 00:16:38,519
How many of these coats do you think
I could put on all at once?

253
00:16:39,716 --> 00:16:42,907
I'll go this way, you go that way.

254
00:17:19,773 --> 00:17:22,190
Okay. For the wedge.

255
00:17:33,413 --> 00:17:35,327
Barney?

256
00:17:42,101 --> 00:17:44,138
- Barney.
- Ted.

257
00:17:44,625 --> 00:17:46,222
- Get your coat, we're leaving.
- What?

258
00:17:46,318 --> 00:17:49,448
What happened to that cutlet
you were grinding with?

259
00:17:49,544 --> 00:17:52,227
- That was my cousin Leslie.
- What?

260
00:17:52,323 --> 00:17:55,740
No. No. No.
We are not laughing about this, Ted.

261
00:17:55,836 --> 00:17:59,095
This is not gonna be some funny story
that we'll be telling in a couple months.

262
00:17:59,191 --> 00:18:01,714
It's not going to be like,
'Hey, remember that time...

263
00:18:01,810 --> 00:18:04,739
'when you were grinding with...' No!

264
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:05,899
And you know why?

265
00:18:05,994 --> 00:18:09,665
Because, italics,
<i>"This night did not happen."</i>

266
00:18:09,763 --> 00:18:12,734
And you promise me
that you will never, ever, ever tell...

267
00:18:12,830 --> 00:18:15,098
another living soul
what transpired here tonight.

268
00:18:15,193 --> 00:18:18,101
- You promise. Promise.
- All right, I promise.

269
00:18:18,196 --> 00:18:20,369
Let's get Marshall and go, okay?

270
00:18:20,464 --> 00:18:24,858
Hey, thanks for saving my night.
I'll talk to you soon?

271
00:18:25,064 --> 00:18:27,492
- Hey, tip her, Barney.
- Why? I didn't check a coat.

272
00:18:27,588 --> 00:18:29,632
And even if I did, on principle
tip jars have become so...

273
00:18:29,727 --> 00:18:31,548
Funny story. Barney was grinding
with this girl all night...

274
00:18:31,644 --> 00:18:33,559
Fine!

275
00:18:33,816 --> 00:18:35,731
Just...

276
00:18:35,861 --> 00:18:37,895
That's a handy new trick.

277
00:18:49,884 --> 00:18:53,014
<i>So Marshall and Lily
rediscovered their youth.</i>

278
00:18:53,110 --> 00:18:55,025
<i>It was nice.</i>

279
00:18:55,505 --> 00:18:58,370
<i>And then it got... icky.</i>

280
00:19:07,228 --> 00:19:11,378
I'm really glad
you guys came out tonight!

281
00:19:12,403 --> 00:19:15,821
You know, dude,
can I just say something?

282
00:19:15,916 --> 00:19:19,047
It kind of hurt that you guys
didn't invite me out.

283
00:19:19,142 --> 00:19:22,337
I mean, I know things have changed
since I got engaged,

284
00:19:22,433 --> 00:19:24,445
but it would've been nice to be asked.

285
00:19:24,541 --> 00:19:29,332
- I'm sorry! I assumed you had other plans.
- They played some good songs tonight.

286
00:19:29,428 --> 00:19:32,974
- I mean, lately...
- I know, I know, it just, seems like...

287
00:19:33,070 --> 00:19:35,944
suddenly we're living
in two different worlds.

288
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:38,021
Maybe you've got more in common
with Barney.

289
00:19:38,117 --> 00:19:41,242
- What?
- Are you crazy?

290
00:19:41,343 --> 00:19:43,515
You think I like going to those clubs?

291
00:19:43,611 --> 00:19:46,645
I'd so much rather go
to your fruity little winetasting.

292
00:19:46,741 --> 00:19:48,242
Oh, my God, I'm gonna barf!

293
00:19:48,338 --> 00:19:51,918
Where's my purse, where's my...
No, I'm okay.

294
00:19:53,034 --> 00:19:55,877
The problem is you can't do
any of that couple stuff...

295
00:19:55,973 --> 00:19:57,857
unless you have someone to do it with.

296
00:19:57,952 --> 00:20:00,380
And the only way I'm gonna find
that someone is by going out...

297
00:20:00,476 --> 00:20:04,626
- and doing stupid single stuff with Barney.
- What?

298
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:07,916
But, man, when I find her...

299
00:20:08,335 --> 00:20:11,209
we're gonna have some
bad-ass winetastings.

300
00:20:11,305 --> 00:20:13,220
It's a plan.

301
00:20:13,892 --> 00:20:16,256
Hey, maybe it'll be that cute coat-check girl.

302
00:20:16,352 --> 00:20:19,129
Yeah. Maybe it will be.

303
00:20:19,354 --> 00:20:21,269
<i>It wasn't.</i>

304
00:20:22,836 --> 00:20:25,551
You know, Ted.
I don't say this nearly enough

305
00:20:25,647 --> 00:20:30,366
- but I really value...
- Hey, that place has great salads.
