<i>When you're single,
and your friends start to get married,</i>

3
00:00:15,626 --> 00:00:19,544
<i>every wedding invitation presents
a strange moment of self-evaluation.</i>

4
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:22,593
<i>Will you be bringing a guest
or will you be attending alone?</i>

5
00:00:22,689 --> 00:00:24,199
<i>What it's really asking is,</i>

6
00:00:24,295 --> 00:00:26,350
<i>where do you see yourself
in three months?</i>

7
00:00:26,446 --> 00:00:29,914
<i>Sitting next to your girlfriend,
or hitting on a bridesmaid?</i>

8
00:00:30,010 --> 00:00:32,676
<i>I always checked
that I was bringing a guest.</i>

9
00:00:32,772 --> 00:00:34,697
<i>I was an optimist.</i>

10
00:00:36,529 --> 00:00:38,102
Who the hell am I gonna bring
to this wedding?

11
00:00:38,199 --> 00:00:40,478
Ted, have you ignored all of my teachings?

12
00:00:40,575 --> 00:00:41,858
For the most part, yeah.

13
00:00:41,954 --> 00:00:43,304
You don't bring a date to a wedding.

14
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:46,868
That's like bringing a deer carcass
on a hunting trip. Oh, Ted. Oh, Ted.

15
00:00:46,964 --> 00:00:48,312
No, no date!

16
00:00:48,409 --> 00:00:50,978
Deer carcass, really? That's the metaphor
you're going with here?

17
00:00:51,074 --> 00:00:52,647
Ted, it's a simile.

18
00:00:52,744 --> 00:00:53,899
Well, it's too late now.

19
00:00:53,996 --> 00:00:57,721
If I don't bring a date, a $200 piece
of chicken/salmon will go uneaten.

20
00:00:57,817 --> 00:00:59,422
I gotta bring someone, but who?

21
00:00:59,518 --> 00:01:01,445
<i>Of course I knew who I wanted to bring.</i>

22
00:01:01,541 --> 00:01:04,720
<i>Robin. The big unanswered question
in my life.</i>

23
00:01:04,817 --> 00:01:08,252
<i>Problem was, she was dating
this really rich guy named Derek.</i>

24
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:11,110
<i>Derek!</i>

25
00:01:11,206 --> 00:01:13,518
Well, Derek and I just broke up.

26
00:01:13,614 --> 00:01:15,829
No, that's terrible. Are you okay?

27
00:01:15,925 --> 00:01:19,201
- Yeah, do you need a drink or something?
- No. We never really clicked.

28
00:01:19,297 --> 00:01:21,063
I felt bad though. He was pretty bummed.

29
00:01:21,159 --> 00:01:23,311
Don't beat yourself up. He'll be fine.

30
00:01:23,407 --> 00:01:25,077
I mean, the guy's, like, a billionaire.

31
00:01:25,173 --> 00:01:27,131
He can put his platinum card
on a fishing line...

32
00:01:27,227 --> 00:01:29,058
and reel in 10 chicks hotter than you.

33
00:01:29,154 --> 00:01:31,049
Thanks. I feel a lot better.

34
00:01:31,145 --> 00:01:33,762
I think I'll get that drink now.

35
00:01:34,864 --> 00:01:37,273
Okay, guys. I gotta say something.

36
00:01:37,369 --> 00:01:41,295
I think my feelings for Robin
may be resurfacing.

37
00:01:41,478 --> 00:01:44,465
Oh, please.
They were buried in a shallow grave.

38
00:01:44,561 --> 00:01:45,556
Not again.

39
00:01:45,653 --> 00:01:48,318
Come on. Dude, we all know
how this movie ends.

40
00:01:48,415 --> 00:01:51,369
Ted falls in love.
Love kicks Ted in the sprouts.

41
00:01:51,465 --> 00:01:52,621
Roll credits.

42
00:01:52,717 --> 00:01:55,382
No! You guys just have to look
at the whole picture.

43
00:01:55,478 --> 00:01:58,913
Fact. Robin was into me when we first met.

44
00:01:59,138 --> 00:02:01,033
<i>Fact. Even though
she didn't want a relationship,</i>

45
00:02:01,129 --> 00:02:03,505
<i>we had an amazing kiss on the roof.</i>

46
00:02:03,601 --> 00:02:06,955
<i>Fact. On New Year's Eve, we kissed again.</i>

47
00:02:07,358 --> 00:02:11,366
Fact. I need a date to this wedding.
Wish me luck.

48
00:02:12,206 --> 00:02:15,353
What I don't get is
why is Claudia marrying Stuart?

49
00:02:15,449 --> 00:02:18,312
She's way hotter than him. How way?

50
00:02:18,596 --> 00:02:20,520
Way way.

51
00:02:20,787 --> 00:02:23,805
This wedding does sound
pretty amazing though.

52
00:02:23,902 --> 00:02:25,826
Fancy hotel ballroom.

53
00:02:25,828 --> 00:02:27,659
Everybody all dressed up.

54
00:02:27,755 --> 00:02:29,328
- Here we go.
- What?

55
00:02:29,424 --> 00:02:31,447
We can't get anywhere
with our wedding plans...

56
00:02:31,543 --> 00:02:34,273
because I want it to be fun
and Marshall wants it to be lame.

57
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:36,873
Yeah, okay, that's a pretty fair
assessment of our two arguments.

58
00:02:36,970 --> 00:02:38,223
I thought so.

59
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:39,667
You know what, excuse me...

60
00:02:39,763 --> 00:02:42,396
if I don't wanna get married
barefoot in the woods next to

61
00:02:42,492 --> 00:02:44,612
Lake No One's Gonna Drive That Far.

62
00:02:44,708 --> 00:02:46,690
Yes, I want a ballroom.

63
00:02:46,924 --> 00:02:49,588
And I want a band. And I want shoes.

64
00:02:49,684 --> 00:02:52,254
I've been dreaming about this day,
since I was, like...

65
00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:54,275
A little girl?

66
00:02:54,341 --> 00:02:55,432
What up?

67
00:02:55,528 --> 00:02:57,616
Okay, I'm just saying
that it's my wedding, too,

68
00:02:57,712 --> 00:02:59,221
and I should have a say in it.

69
00:02:59,317 --> 00:03:01,051
Yes, but I'm the bride, so I win.

70
00:03:01,147 --> 00:03:04,198
Well, I thought marriage was about
two equal partners sharing a life together.

71
00:03:04,294 --> 00:03:07,157
Right, but I'm the bride, so I win.

72
00:03:07,441 --> 00:03:09,914
I mean, seriously. Claudia and Stuart?

73
00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:11,583
I mean, I've hooked up with the odd lass...

74
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,477
who was beneath
my level of attractiveness.

75
00:03:13,573 --> 00:03:15,243
But, you know, I was drunk.

76
00:03:15,339 --> 00:03:18,615
There's no way Claudia
has been drunk for three years.

77
00:03:18,711 --> 00:03:20,092
You know, I've always found...

78
00:03:20,188 --> 00:03:22,372
that the best way
to get over a failed relationship...

79
00:03:22,468 --> 00:03:24,459
is to celebrate someone else's
successful one.

80
00:03:24,555 --> 00:03:26,480
Makes sense.

81
00:03:26,578 --> 00:03:27,862
So, with that in mind,

82
00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:31,908
our friends Claudia and Stuart are having
this crazy black tie wedding on Saturday.

83
00:03:32,004 --> 00:03:33,931
You wanna be my plus one?

84
00:03:34,027 --> 00:03:36,563
Plus one. You make it sound so romantic.

85
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:38,584
Fine.

86
00:03:39,128 --> 00:03:40,765
You wanna be my date?

87
00:03:40,862 --> 00:03:42,786
Your date?

88
00:03:43,206 --> 00:03:44,683
I'd love to.

89
00:03:44,779 --> 00:03:46,673
How fancy are we talking about here?

90
00:03:46,769 --> 00:03:49,274
- You're gonna wanna bring your 'A' game.
- I'll bring it.

91
00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:54,122
I'll bring it so hard the bride's gonna look
like a big white bag of crap.

92
00:03:54,218 --> 00:03:56,232
Lily, I need a dress.

93
00:03:56,338 --> 00:03:57,814
You're going? That's awesome!

94
00:03:57,911 --> 00:03:59,645
Oh, my God, four days to find a dress?

95
00:03:59,741 --> 00:04:01,314
I know. It's a suicide mission.

96
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:02,760
Well, if we leave now...

97
00:04:02,856 --> 00:04:05,328
- we can still have a fighting chance.
- Let's do it.

98
00:04:05,424 --> 00:04:07,349
Bye, babe.

99
00:04:07,511 --> 00:04:09,824
Did you see how fired up she was?

100
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,557
I don't know, there's something there.

101
00:04:11,653 --> 00:04:14,736
And come Saturday, little music,
little dancing, a lot of champagne.

102
00:04:14,794 --> 00:04:15,950
Who knows?

103
00:04:16,046 --> 00:04:17,973
Ted, you're gonna have to find
another gender for yourself...

104
00:04:18,069 --> 00:04:20,413
'cause I'm revoking your dude membership.

105
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:23,618
Yeah, how was that manicure yesterday?

106
00:04:23,849 --> 00:04:25,773
Invigorating, thanks.

107
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:28,686
<i>Okay, I wasn't going to say it
in front of the guys,</i>

108
00:04:28,782 --> 00:04:32,954
<i>but back then
I really thought that's how it worked.</i>

109
00:04:35,718 --> 00:04:40,707
<i>You put yourself and a girl you like
in some romantic setting.</i>

110
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:43,775
<i>The stars line up,</i>

111
00:04:44,098 --> 00:04:46,023
<i>and shazam!</i>

112
00:04:48,016 --> 00:04:50,199
<i>I know now that life is never that simple.</i>

113
00:04:50,295 --> 00:04:52,220
Hey, Claudia!

114
00:04:52,446 --> 00:04:55,882
Yes, I want Tahitian vanilla!
You wrote it down wrong?

115
00:04:55,979 --> 00:04:57,327
No, no, no! Listen to me.

116
00:04:57,423 --> 00:04:59,960
If I go to my wedding and the cake
is not Tahitian vanilla,

117
00:05:00,056 --> 00:05:02,818
I will come down there and burn
your little shop to the ground.

118
00:05:02,914 --> 00:05:06,446
Do you wanna find out if I'm kidding?
Yeah, goodbye.

119
00:05:06,542 --> 00:05:07,538
Hey!

120
00:05:09,015 --> 00:05:09,978
How's it going?

121
00:05:10,074 --> 00:05:12,482
My wedding is in two days,
that's how it's going.

122
00:05:12,578 --> 00:05:15,212
Don't worry. It's gonna be great.
I'm so excited.

123
00:05:15,308 --> 00:05:16,945
You should be. Lots of single girls.

124
00:05:17,041 --> 00:05:19,161
Well, yeah, I'm bringing a date.

125
00:05:19,258 --> 00:05:21,987
- So I'll be off the market.
- What?

126
00:05:22,083 --> 00:05:23,303
I'm bringing a date.

127
00:05:23,399 --> 00:05:25,390
You're not bringing a date.

128
00:05:25,486 --> 00:05:26,642
Yes, I am.

129
00:05:26,738 --> 00:05:28,663
No, you're not.

130
00:05:28,665 --> 00:05:31,041
- I checked plus one.
- No, you didn't.

131
00:05:31,137 --> 00:05:32,839
Claudia, I'm pretty sure I checked...

132
00:05:32,936 --> 00:05:34,477
Ted! You did not check plus one!

133
00:05:34,573 --> 00:05:38,009
You are not bringing a date to my wedding!

134
00:05:42,274 --> 00:05:43,975
But I already invited someone.

135
00:05:44,072 --> 00:05:45,678
You are not bringing a guest, Ted.

136
00:05:45,774 --> 00:05:47,893
The guest list has been closed
for months. Months.

137
00:05:47,989 --> 00:05:50,429
But I checked plus one.
I always check plus one.

138
00:05:50,526 --> 00:05:52,677
You absolutely did not check plus one.

139
00:05:52,774 --> 00:05:53,994
If you had checked plus one,
I'd have called you...

140
00:05:54,090 --> 00:05:56,498
to get the name of your guest,
so I could have the place cards printed up.

141
00:05:56,594 --> 00:05:57,718
Did I call you to get the name
of your guest?

142
00:05:57,814 --> 00:05:59,613
Is there a place card
with her name printed on it?

143
00:05:59,709 --> 00:06:01,539
She doesn't need a place card.
She knows her name.

144
00:06:01,635 --> 00:06:02,759
What's she eating?

145
00:06:02,855 --> 00:06:04,590
You ordered the chicken.
What did she order?

146
00:06:04,686 --> 00:06:07,190
Do you see how your story is full of holes?

147
00:06:07,286 --> 00:06:09,212
Come on, Claudia. We go way back.

148
00:06:09,309 --> 00:06:11,203
Isn't there room for just one more person?

149
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:13,590
Don't make me hurt you, Ted.

150
00:06:14,254 --> 00:06:16,855
I don't believe this. Claudia's crazy.

151
00:06:16,951 --> 00:06:18,781
But to be fair, she's also hot.

152
00:06:18,878 --> 00:06:20,771
I totally checked plus one. I'm sure I did.

153
00:06:20,868 --> 00:06:22,217
- Yeah, right.
- I did!

154
00:06:22,313 --> 00:06:24,497
Yeah, I don't think you did.
You know why?

155
00:06:24,593 --> 00:06:27,098
Because deep down, you didn't want
to show up at this thing with a date.

156
00:06:27,194 --> 00:06:30,500
See, for all your big talk about
being ready for a relationship,

157
00:06:30,596 --> 00:06:31,720
deep down you're single.

158
00:06:31,817 --> 00:06:33,647
It's your default setting.

159
00:06:33,743 --> 00:06:36,216
Ted, you know what's
in the back of your brain?

160
00:06:36,313 --> 00:06:38,143
Great, here comes the little Barney speech.

161
00:06:38,239 --> 00:06:40,390
Behind a curtain, in a dark little room,

162
00:06:40,486 --> 00:06:42,926
secretly controlling your every move...

163
00:06:43,023 --> 00:06:45,110
- A little Barney.
- A little Barney.

164
00:06:45,206 --> 00:06:47,131
A little Barney.

165
00:06:48,129 --> 00:06:49,702
And you know what he said?

166
00:06:49,798 --> 00:06:53,488
'Ted, you will bring no date
to this wedding.

167
00:06:53,587 --> 00:06:57,857
'You will hit on drunk bridesmaids
with actual size Barney.'

168
00:06:57,954 --> 00:06:59,878
Wow, please stop.

169
00:07:00,555 --> 00:07:02,160
I gotta call Claudia.
If I just explain to her...

170
00:07:02,256 --> 00:07:04,022
Ted, no. Let it go.

171
00:07:04,118 --> 00:07:06,430
She's about to get married.
She's got enough to worry about.

172
00:07:06,527 --> 00:07:07,714
Then what am I gonna do?

173
00:07:07,810 --> 00:07:12,064
The only thing you can do.
Tell Robin she can't come.

174
00:07:14,845 --> 00:07:16,291
Just a second.

175
00:07:18,345 --> 00:07:19,405
Hey.

176
00:07:19,502 --> 00:07:21,717
- Listen...
- Wait, two things. First of all,

177
00:07:21,813 --> 00:07:23,451
I've been laying groundwork all afternoon.

178
00:07:23,547 --> 00:07:26,661
Totally subtle. Totally cool. Not pushing.
Not even nudging.

179
00:07:26,757 --> 00:07:28,845
Just, the theme of today is, 'Ted rocks!'

180
00:07:28,941 --> 00:07:30,739
And she's picking up what I'm laying down.

181
00:07:30,836 --> 00:07:32,858
- Lily, there's a problem...
- Wait, no. Thing number two,

182
00:07:32,955 --> 00:07:35,231
the dress. We got a dress.

183
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:40,145
Go.

184
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:43,000
Well, did I bring it,

185
00:07:44,963 --> 00:07:48,235
or did I bring it? I think I brought it.

186
00:07:48,912 --> 00:07:51,857
- Wow!
- That's what I was going for.

187
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:55,013
I'm so excited about tomorrow.
We're gonna have so much fun.

188
00:07:55,109 --> 00:07:57,034
Yeah, about that...

189
00:07:58,931 --> 00:08:00,976
I'll pick you up at 5:00.

190
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:09,484
So, the dress?

191
00:08:09,967 --> 00:08:12,344
- I don't have a plus one for the wedding.
- What?

192
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:15,587
I ran into Claudia and she told me
I didn't check plus one on the reply card.

193
00:08:15,683 --> 00:08:18,252
- Why didn't you check plus...
- I did check plus one.

194
00:08:18,348 --> 00:08:20,564
- But Robin is so excited.
- I know.

195
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:22,705
- And the dress.
- I know.

196
00:08:23,582 --> 00:08:25,605
Okay, okay. We'll sneak her in.

197
00:08:25,701 --> 00:08:27,980
We can't sneak her in. We're not ninjas.

198
00:08:28,077 --> 00:08:30,776
- I wish we were ninjas.
- I know.

199
00:08:31,962 --> 00:08:33,664
You could always ask Stuart.

200
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,237
- Can I do that?
- Well, sure.

201
00:08:35,333 --> 00:08:37,838
You guys have been friends for a long time.

202
00:08:37,934 --> 00:08:40,388
And it's 40% his wedding, too.

203
00:08:41,274 --> 00:08:43,168
I don't know. It's gonna be a tough sell.

204
00:08:43,265 --> 00:08:45,768
- Dude, no problem whatsoever.
- Really?

205
00:08:45,865 --> 00:08:47,535
Sure, the more the merrier.

206
00:08:47,631 --> 00:08:50,007
Wow! Wow, thanks for being
so cool about this.

207
00:08:50,104 --> 00:08:51,163
'Cause you know, Claudia said...

208
00:08:51,259 --> 00:08:52,768
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
This morning at the rehearsal,

209
00:08:52,864 --> 00:08:56,429
Claudia called our 7-year-old
flower girl a whore.

210
00:08:56,525 --> 00:08:58,965
So don't take it personally,
she's just a little stressed.

211
00:08:59,062 --> 00:09:02,415
- Yeah, she's not usually like that.
- No.

212
00:09:04,295 --> 00:09:08,222
Well, thanks, Stu.
It's gonna be a great wedding.

213
00:09:10,267 --> 00:09:12,129
Honey, this magazine says
more and more couples...

214
00:09:12,226 --> 00:09:15,341
are opting to have non-traditional
weddings out in the woods.

215
00:09:15,437 --> 00:09:18,230
Well, if a magazine says so, we should
go get married in the woods,

216
00:09:18,327 --> 00:09:20,535
like a couple of squirrels.

217
00:09:20,575 --> 00:09:23,015
Squirrels don't get married, Marshall.

218
00:09:23,111 --> 00:09:25,892
Like you could possibly know that.

219
00:09:26,258 --> 00:09:28,891
I did it. I did it.
I'm taking her to the wedding.

220
00:09:28,987 --> 00:09:30,496
- Nice.
- What? How?

221
00:09:30,592 --> 00:09:32,517
I talked to Stuart.

222
00:09:32,807 --> 00:09:34,831
You went around the bride.

223
00:09:34,927 --> 00:09:36,693
This hornet's nest looks harmless.

224
00:09:36,789 --> 00:09:38,844
Maybe I'll poke it with a stick.

225
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:41,733
Look, some gremlins.
Let me go feed them after midnight.

226
00:09:41,830 --> 00:09:43,811
Did you know about this?

227
00:09:44,142 --> 00:09:46,187
It may have been my idea.

228
00:09:46,486 --> 00:09:49,146
What? Stuart doesn't get a say?

229
00:09:49,696 --> 00:09:52,394
So you admit it.
The groom should have an equal say.

230
00:09:52,490 --> 00:09:53,678
Oh, yeah, sure.

231
00:09:53,775 --> 00:09:56,054
On the stupid stuff, like who comes.

232
00:09:56,151 --> 00:09:57,788
So I can invite whoever I want?

233
00:09:57,885 --> 00:10:00,517
Sure. There's plenty of room in the woods.

234
00:10:03,278 --> 00:10:05,840
- It's Claudia.
- So it begins.

235
00:10:06,458 --> 00:10:08,912
Come on. It can't be that bad.

236
00:10:09,379 --> 00:10:10,921
Here, Lily, you answer it.

237
00:10:10,955 --> 00:10:11,918
What? Why?

238
00:10:12,014 --> 00:10:14,808
Because this whole thing was your idea.
And Claudia scares me.

239
00:10:14,904 --> 00:10:17,083
But you're the guy...

240
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:19,195
Ted's phone.

241
00:10:19,291 --> 00:10:21,215
Hi, Claudia.

242
00:10:21,570 --> 00:10:22,565
What?

243
00:10:22,662 --> 00:10:26,836
<i>Now, I wasn't there, but from what
I heard, it went something like this.</i>

244
00:10:26,932 --> 00:10:28,473
By the way, honey, Ted stopped by...

245
00:10:28,569 --> 00:10:30,721
and I told him he could bring his date
to the wedding.

246
00:10:30,817 --> 00:10:31,845
You what?

247
00:10:31,941 --> 00:10:34,381
I told him he could bring
a date to the wedding.

248
00:10:34,478 --> 00:10:37,496
Just tell me, instead of
always undermining me at every turn.

249
00:10:39,969 --> 00:10:45,122
Try to show a little flexibility.
But no. It's all about you.

250
00:10:46,968 --> 00:10:50,485
And your mother. Calling me all the time...

251
00:10:51,816 --> 00:10:54,516
You know what? The wedding's off.

252
00:10:57,243 --> 00:10:59,451
They broke up.

253
00:11:01,641 --> 00:11:03,697
It's not because of me, is it?

254
00:11:03,793 --> 00:11:06,587
And my dad already paid
for this huge wedding.

255
00:11:06,683 --> 00:11:08,223
He's gonna kill me.

256
00:11:09,347 --> 00:11:10,536
Then he's gonna kill Ted.

257
00:11:10,632 --> 00:11:12,595
Then I'm gonna kill Ted.

258
00:11:12,719 --> 00:11:15,063
- It's Robin.
- Answer it.

259
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:17,310
- Lily's phone.
- Ted? Where's Lily?

260
00:11:17,407 --> 00:11:20,329
I need to tell her about
these awesome shoes I just bought.

261
00:11:20,425 --> 00:11:22,350
Lily's busy.

262
00:11:22,352 --> 00:11:24,439
Okay. Well, I just wanted to say
they're gorgeous...

263
00:11:24,535 --> 00:11:25,883
and Ted's gonna love them.

264
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:28,292
That's great. I'll tell Lily to tell me.

265
00:11:28,388 --> 00:11:31,117
Listen. I really wanna keep talking
but now's not a good time.

266
00:11:31,214 --> 00:11:33,301
So, I'm really excited
about tomorrow, okay, bye.

267
00:11:33,397 --> 00:11:34,778
- Okay, bye.
- Crap.

268
00:11:34,874 --> 00:11:36,287
She bought some expensive shoes.

269
00:11:36,383 --> 00:11:38,309
She's really looking forward to this.

270
00:11:38,406 --> 00:11:40,397
- Do you think she's into me?
- Ted, focus.

271
00:11:40,493 --> 00:11:41,649
Okay, okay, sweetie.

272
00:11:41,745 --> 00:11:44,860
Just calm down.
Do you wanna go somewhere and talk?

273
00:11:44,956 --> 00:11:46,883
I wanna go somewhere and drink.

274
00:11:46,979 --> 00:11:50,823
Okay. Meet me at MacLaren's.
I'll see you there.

275
00:11:51,185 --> 00:11:53,272
- I feel terrible.
- Well, feel terrible later.

276
00:11:53,368 --> 00:11:54,332
Right now we gotta fix this.

277
00:11:54,428 --> 00:11:56,033
Lily, you go down to the bar
and comfort Claudia.

278
00:11:56,129 --> 00:11:58,506
Ted and I'll go and try to talk
some sense into Stuart.

279
00:11:58,602 --> 00:12:00,239
Tell Claudia I'm sorry.

280
00:12:00,335 --> 00:12:01,588
Did she seem pissed at me?

281
00:12:01,685 --> 00:12:06,597
She said if there's no wedding tomorrow,
you owe her father $400,000.

282
00:12:06,693 --> 00:12:10,456
What say we get these crazy kids
back together.

283
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:17,086
Hi, sad eyes. What's got you down?

284
00:12:19,184 --> 00:12:21,581
Stuart and I just broke up.

285
00:12:22,041 --> 00:12:24,537
Oh, God, I'm so sorry.

286
00:12:24,642 --> 00:12:28,527
That's just... That's...
Two vodka cranberries, please.

287
00:12:28,623 --> 00:12:31,128
You remembered I drink vodka cranberries.

288
00:12:31,224 --> 00:12:32,830
Remember?

289
00:12:32,926 --> 00:12:36,116
When it comes to you, how can I forget?

290
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,699
They all drink vodka cranberries.

291
00:12:41,114 --> 00:12:44,712
So, is there anything else
you need, sweetie?

292
00:12:46,091 --> 00:12:48,269
You got $400,000?

293
00:12:48,370 --> 00:12:51,030
No. But I do have a hug.

294
00:12:56,814 --> 00:12:58,739
Thank you.

295
00:13:00,058 --> 00:13:01,568
Stuart, I don't know what to say.

296
00:13:01,664 --> 00:13:03,719
- If I caused this in any way...
- Ted, for all I know you did me...

297
00:13:03,815 --> 00:13:05,838
the biggest favor anyone's ever done me.

298
00:13:05,934 --> 00:13:07,861
- Come on, man, you don't mean that.
- No, I do.

299
00:13:07,957 --> 00:13:10,397
This whole thing's made me realize
I miss being single.

300
00:13:10,493 --> 00:13:13,544
I miss staying out late and making
messes and not cleaning them up.

301
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:16,884
- I miss owning porn!
- Dude, who doesn't?

302
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:19,806
And, you know, I'll see some
super hot model chick and I'll think,

303
00:13:19,902 --> 00:13:22,599
'Why am I with Claudia?
I could be with her.'

304
00:13:22,695 --> 00:13:24,620
That's just crazy.

305
00:13:25,071 --> 00:13:26,580
I mean, you're the luckiest...

306
00:13:26,676 --> 00:13:28,218
You and Claudia both are the luckiest.

307
00:13:28,314 --> 00:13:30,337
The point is, I wanna get married.
I want to settle down.

308
00:13:30,433 --> 00:13:32,938
But right now, that's just not who I am.
I'm not a commitment guy.

309
00:13:33,034 --> 00:13:33,997
I'm a single guy.

310
00:13:34,094 --> 00:13:36,791
Stuart, you don't have
to be one or the other.

311
00:13:36,887 --> 00:13:39,039
Everybody feels this way sometimes.

312
00:13:39,135 --> 00:13:41,254
Relationships aren't easy.
They're hard work.

313
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:44,433
It's about compromise, growing together,
all that Dr. Phil crap.

314
00:13:44,529 --> 00:13:46,424
Yeah, how would you know?
You're not even married.

315
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:49,313
Okay, ask this guy.
Nine years he's been with Lily.

316
00:13:49,410 --> 00:13:51,079
He's the pro.
This guy knows relationships.

317
00:13:51,175 --> 00:13:53,100
Tell him, Marshall.

318
00:13:53,776 --> 00:13:54,900
Stuart, don't get married.

319
00:13:54,997 --> 00:13:56,217
- What?
- Dude!

320
00:13:56,313 --> 00:13:57,757
Look, I'm sorry.

321
00:13:57,854 --> 00:14:00,294
Being in a couple is hard and committing,

322
00:14:00,390 --> 00:14:02,285
making sacrifices, it's hard.

323
00:14:02,381 --> 00:14:05,175
But if it's the right person, then it's easy.

324
00:14:05,271 --> 00:14:07,615
Looking at that girl and knowing
she's all you really want out of life,

325
00:14:07,711 --> 00:14:09,445
that should be the easiest thing
in the world.

326
00:14:09,542 --> 00:14:11,147
And if it's not like that,

327
00:14:11,243 --> 00:14:13,168
then she's not the one.

328
00:14:13,170 --> 00:14:15,094
I'm sorry.

329
00:14:18,821 --> 00:14:21,929
You know I don't have $400,000, right?

330
00:14:22,641 --> 00:14:25,114
Maybe we got together too young.

331
00:14:25,211 --> 00:14:27,458
Maybe that's what the problem was.

332
00:14:27,554 --> 00:14:30,696
I mean, I'm 28 years old,

333
00:14:31,183 --> 00:14:34,490
and I've really only ever been with one man.

334
00:14:35,742 --> 00:14:38,621
That's just... That's...

335
00:14:38,728 --> 00:14:41,591
Two more vodka cranberries, please.

336
00:14:43,127 --> 00:14:46,137
Claudia, it's all gonna be okay.

337
00:14:48,521 --> 00:14:50,769
Thanks for listening, Barney.

338
00:14:50,865 --> 00:14:53,156
It really means a lot to me.

339
00:14:53,722 --> 00:14:58,058
Isn't it weird that we should
run into each other like this?

340
00:14:58,154 --> 00:15:00,078
Two souls...

341
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:02,861
of equal levels of attractiveness.

342
00:15:02,924 --> 00:15:08,240
Both fitting together like
two pieces of a very attractive puzzle.

343
00:15:09,216 --> 00:15:10,726
Oh, hell no!

344
00:15:13,166 --> 00:15:15,189
Claudia is getting married tomorrow,

345
00:15:15,285 --> 00:15:17,083
and, so help me God, if I catch you...

346
00:15:17,179 --> 00:15:19,556
even so much as breathing
the same air as her,

347
00:15:19,652 --> 00:15:22,317
I will take those peanuts
you're trying to pass off as testicles...

348
00:15:22,413 --> 00:15:24,918
and I will squeeze them so hard
your eyes pop out,

349
00:15:25,014 --> 00:15:27,807
and then I'll feed them to you like grapes.

350
00:15:27,904 --> 00:15:30,152
Wait. My eyes or my testicles?

351
00:15:30,248 --> 00:15:31,339
One of each.

352
00:15:31,435 --> 00:15:33,360
All right. All right.

353
00:15:33,619 --> 00:15:35,288
Claudia.

354
00:15:35,385 --> 00:15:36,605
Stuart!

355
00:15:36,701 --> 00:15:39,078
- I'm so sorry.
- I'm so sorry, too.

356
00:15:39,174 --> 00:15:41,839
- I love you.
- I love you, too, babe.

357
00:15:41,935 --> 00:15:43,669
Marshall and Ted set me straight.

358
00:15:43,765 --> 00:15:46,494
And when Marshall told me
not to marry you it made me realize I...

359
00:15:46,590 --> 00:15:47,940
- Marshall said what?
- No, no, no...

360
00:15:48,036 --> 00:15:49,064
It's more complicated than that.

361
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:50,637
No, he made me realize
how much I love you.

362
00:15:50,733 --> 00:15:52,531
These guys got us back together.

363
00:15:52,627 --> 00:15:54,672
Okay, I'm cool. I'm cool.

364
00:16:08,264 --> 00:16:10,993
So, where'd we land on
the whole plus one thing?

365
00:16:12,502 --> 00:16:13,562
No, no, no, no. No.

366
00:16:13,593 --> 00:16:16,836
<i>It took three more vodka cranberries
to subdue Claudia.</i>

367
00:16:16,932 --> 00:16:21,676
<i>But eventually she graciously
agreed to let me bring Robin.</i>

368
00:16:22,855 --> 00:16:24,780
Still wow.

369
00:16:24,782 --> 00:16:27,189
Wow yourself. Look who else brought it.

370
00:16:27,285 --> 00:16:28,442
Oh, yeah.

371
00:16:28,538 --> 00:16:31,813
I thought about leaving it at home,
but I figured, I don't want to get there...

372
00:16:31,909 --> 00:16:34,125
and realize I need it and have to go
all the way back to get it.

373
00:16:34,221 --> 00:16:36,145
So, yeah, I brought it.

374
00:16:37,561 --> 00:16:39,485
Sorry.

375
00:16:41,574 --> 00:16:43,498
Hello?

376
00:16:44,432 --> 00:16:45,620
Oh, my God, tonight?

377
00:16:45,716 --> 00:16:46,904
You're kidding.

378
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,409
They want me to anchor the news tonight.

379
00:16:49,505 --> 00:16:50,661
Really?

380
00:16:50,757 --> 00:16:52,804
Like, anchor anchor?

381
00:16:54,193 --> 00:16:56,248
Well, what happened to Sandy?

382
00:16:56,344 --> 00:16:57,885
Okay.

383
00:16:57,982 --> 00:17:02,235
Okay. Sure. What time do you
need me to... Right now?

384
00:17:03,536 --> 00:17:05,461
Do it.

385
00:17:06,651 --> 00:17:08,576
Do it.

386
00:17:09,605 --> 00:17:11,981
Okay, I need, like, five minutes to change,

387
00:17:12,077 --> 00:17:14,777
and I'll call you from the cab...

388
00:17:23,797 --> 00:17:25,049
So admit it.

389
00:17:25,145 --> 00:17:28,499
This wedding is both indoors and amazing.

390
00:17:28,613 --> 00:17:31,342
I'll give you the crab puffs.
The crab puffs are good.

391
00:17:31,439 --> 00:17:32,466
The crab puffs were incredible.

392
00:17:32,563 --> 00:17:34,297
We should totally have them
at our wedding.

393
00:17:34,393 --> 00:17:36,318
Definitely.

394
00:17:37,026 --> 00:17:38,631
We just agreed on something.

395
00:17:38,727 --> 00:17:43,880
- Did we just start planning our wedding?
- I think that we did.

396
00:17:45,246 --> 00:17:47,204
We totally have to get
that brown dipping sauce.

397
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:49,901
I think the red sauce was, like, awesome.

398
00:17:49,997 --> 00:17:53,351
My God, were you born without taste buds?

399
00:17:54,011 --> 00:17:55,936
What?

400
00:17:56,097 --> 00:17:58,022
I love you.

401
00:18:03,611 --> 00:18:06,180
Coming up, are there snakes
living in your walls?

402
00:18:06,277 --> 00:18:09,876
The answer may surprise you.
After the break.

403
00:18:16,359 --> 00:18:18,991
Man, you know something,
Stuart's my new hero.

404
00:18:19,088 --> 00:18:21,110
If that dude can bag a nine,

405
00:18:21,207 --> 00:18:23,551
I gotta be able to bag, like, a 16.

406
00:18:23,647 --> 00:18:25,413
What's a 16?

407
00:18:25,509 --> 00:18:28,781
Those two eights right over there. Yeah.

408
00:18:30,068 --> 00:18:31,993
- Hi, Ted.
- Claudia.

409
00:18:32,028 --> 00:18:33,986
We just wanted to get a picture...

410
00:18:34,082 --> 00:18:36,169
with the woman who almost
ended our relationship.

411
00:18:36,265 --> 00:18:38,190
Yeah, where is she?

412
00:18:39,541 --> 00:18:41,466
She couldn't make it.

413
00:18:44,228 --> 00:18:48,073
- What's so funny?
- Plan a wedding. You'll see.

414
00:18:52,223 --> 00:18:53,700
Look at that.

415
00:18:53,797 --> 00:18:56,398
That's how it's supposed to be.
That right there.

416
00:18:56,494 --> 00:18:58,418
Easy. Simple.

417
00:18:58,709 --> 00:19:01,182
It's just not like that with Robin.

418
00:19:01,278 --> 00:19:03,719
It's not easy, and on some level,

419
00:19:03,815 --> 00:19:05,796
it has to just be easy.

420
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:11,388
Speaking of easy, bridesmaids, Ted.
Bridesmaids.

421
00:19:11,745 --> 00:19:15,262
By the way, I almost forgot. We found this.

422
00:19:20,233 --> 00:19:22,196
I didn't check plus one.

423
00:19:22,577 --> 00:19:23,701
You were right.

424
00:19:23,797 --> 00:19:25,722
Of course I was right.

425
00:19:26,783 --> 00:19:28,708
I'm single.

426
00:19:28,774 --> 00:19:31,246
Maybe that's just who I am.
And you know what?

427
00:19:31,342 --> 00:19:33,141
- I like being single.
- Being single's the best.

428
00:19:33,237 --> 00:19:36,095
- Yeah! Stay out as late as you want.
- Answer to no one.

429
00:19:36,191 --> 00:19:38,664
The whole world
full of endless possibilities.

430
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:42,032
Never having to go to a farmer's market.

431
00:19:45,534 --> 00:19:47,743
Okay, doing some math here.

432
00:19:48,264 --> 00:19:49,677
Table six has got three bridesmaids.

433
00:19:49,773 --> 00:19:52,214
An eight, an eight, and a seven.

434
00:19:52,310 --> 00:19:54,814
I am willing to give you one of the eights,

435
00:19:54,910 --> 00:19:56,708
lowering myself to a fifteen.

436
00:19:56,805 --> 00:19:58,931
Which means, you owe me...

437
00:19:59,149 --> 00:20:01,429
<i>So there we were. Two single guys...</i>

438
00:20:01,525 --> 00:20:04,030
<i>doing our usual single guy thing.</i>

439
00:20:04,126 --> 00:20:06,213
<i>For whatever reason,
I had let myself believe...</i>

440
00:20:06,309 --> 00:20:08,428
<i>that this night would be a turning point.</i>

441
00:20:08,524 --> 00:20:13,019
<i>That this was the night my life,
my real life, would finally begin.</i>

442
00:20:13,116 --> 00:20:16,633
<i>The funny thing is, I wasn't totally wrong.</i>

443
00:20:23,134 --> 00:20:26,242
<i>Because that night was just beginning.</i>
