<i>Kids, something you...</i>

3
00:00:04,563 --> 00:00:05,845
<i>might not know about
your Uncle Marshall...</i>

4
00:00:05,942 --> 00:00:08,004
<i>is that he's always been good at games.</i>

5
00:00:08,101 --> 00:00:09,390
<i>I mean unbeatable.</i>

6
00:00:09,486 --> 00:00:11,417
Gin!

7
00:00:12,514 --> 00:00:14,445
Yahtzee!

8
00:00:14,866 --> 00:00:16,638
Poker!

9
00:00:16,735 --> 00:00:18,862
You don't have to shout out 'poker'
when you win.

10
00:00:18,958 --> 00:00:20,398
I know. It's just fun to say.

11
00:00:21,041 --> 00:00:22,106
<i>We all finally agreed,</i>

12
00:00:22,202 --> 00:00:23,909
<i>Marshall should be
running our game nights,</i>

13
00:00:24,006 --> 00:00:25,230
<i>instead of playing in them.</i>

14
00:00:25,327 --> 00:00:28,323
<i>Which he took to mean,
'lnvent your own game.'</i>

15
00:00:28,419 --> 00:00:30,891
It's called 'Marshgammon.'

16
00:00:31,352 --> 00:00:33,897
It combines all the best features
of all the best games,

17
00:00:33,993 --> 00:00:36,120
Candyland, I Never, Pictionary.

18
00:00:36,216 --> 00:00:37,763
- Backgammon, obviously.
- No.

19
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:39,342
Backgammon sucks.

20
00:00:39,438 --> 00:00:41,758
I took the only good part of
'backgammon,' the 'gammon,'

21
00:00:41,854 --> 00:00:45,495
and I left the rest of it in the trash
where it belongs.

22
00:00:45,592 --> 00:00:47,879
I'm so excited Victoria's coming.

23
00:00:47,976 --> 00:00:49,748
I'm gonna go get another round.

24
00:00:49,844 --> 00:00:52,357
Okay. I wanna lay down
some ground rules for tonight, Barney.

25
00:00:52,454 --> 00:00:55,057
I actually like Victoria a lot.

26
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:58,772
So, don't say anything...
Don't say anything.

27
00:00:59,027 --> 00:01:01,830
And, guys, I haven't exactly told Victoria...

28
00:01:01,926 --> 00:01:03,826
that I used to have a kind of thing for Robin,

29
00:01:03,923 --> 00:01:08,434
- so if we could just avoid the...
- Well, well, well, how rich.

30
00:01:08,530 --> 00:01:11,688
You make me promise to be on
my best behavior around your girlfriend,

31
00:01:11,784 --> 00:01:14,877
yet you have been lying to her
since day one.

32
00:01:14,974 --> 00:01:16,905
Excuse me.

33
00:01:17,003 --> 00:01:18,099
Hi, Leg Warehouse?

34
00:01:18,196 --> 00:01:20,612
Yeah, my friend Ted
needs something to stand on.

35
00:01:20,708 --> 00:01:24,832
So, nothing for him to stand on?
Okay, thanks so much.

36
00:01:24,929 --> 00:01:28,977
Ted, doesn't Victoria deserve to know
that you once had the hots for Robin?

37
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:33,123
I have half a mind
to tell the story of the re-return.

38
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:35,668
No,
I swore you to secrecy on that.

39
00:01:35,765 --> 00:01:39,374
I am smelling dirt.
What is the story of the re-return?

40
00:01:39,471 --> 00:01:41,081
Nothing. It's nothing.

41
00:01:41,178 --> 00:01:42,692
And, speaking of digging up dirt,

42
00:01:42,788 --> 00:01:44,979
can I count on you two
to behave around Victoria?

43
00:01:45,076 --> 00:01:47,064
Us? What would we do?

44
00:01:47,428 --> 00:01:50,746
Look, you guys have always been
like the parents that I still have,

45
00:01:50,843 --> 00:01:52,809
and, in fact, moved here to get away from.

46
00:01:52,905 --> 00:01:55,869
However, could we skip
the traditional interrogation...

47
00:01:55,965 --> 00:01:58,124
of the new girlfriend tonight?

48
00:01:58,221 --> 00:01:59,380
- Fine.
- Fine.

49
00:01:59,477 --> 00:02:00,508
Thank you.

50
00:02:00,605 --> 00:02:03,231
- I should go help Robin.
- Okay.

51
00:02:05,051 --> 00:02:06,533
- Hey.
- Hey.

52
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:09,884
So, you gonna be okay
hanging out with Victoria tonight?

53
00:02:09,980 --> 00:02:11,911
Oh, sure. She's great.

54
00:02:12,493 --> 00:02:14,974
Oh, what? Because of the whole thing
where I said I liked Ted?

55
00:02:15,071 --> 00:02:16,649
No. Victoria is great.

56
00:02:16,746 --> 00:02:19,968
She's fun, she's free-spirited. She's great.

57
00:02:20,065 --> 00:02:21,965
I said 'She's great' too many times,
didn't I?

58
00:02:22,061 --> 00:02:24,606
You must really hate the bitch.

59
00:02:25,219 --> 00:02:29,085
But if you roll an even number
while adjacent to the Peppermint Forest,

60
00:02:29,181 --> 00:02:32,210
then you 'Marshall Out,'
and all your chips go into the pot.

61
00:02:32,307 --> 00:02:36,012
And remember,
if you ever ask the question, 'What,'

62
00:02:36,108 --> 00:02:38,228
then you gotta drink.

63
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:39,813
Got it?

64
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:42,133
- No idea what you're talking about.
- No idea what you're talking about.

65
00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:43,228
Okay, okay. All right, no, no.

66
00:02:43,325 --> 00:02:45,580
We'll just start. You guys will pick it up.
Newbie goes first.

67
00:02:45,677 --> 00:02:47,647
- Roll.
- Okay.

68
00:02:48,094 --> 00:02:51,246
Three! You got 'Autobiography.'

69
00:02:51,348 --> 00:02:54,795
Now, that's where you have to answer
a personal question about your dating life,

70
00:02:54,891 --> 00:02:56,631
truthfully, in order to move on.

71
00:02:56,728 --> 00:03:01,652
- Marshall, come on.
- Hey. She's the one who rolled a three.

72
00:03:01,731 --> 00:03:02,988
Victoria.

73
00:03:03,084 --> 00:03:06,306
'Have you ever cheated
while in a relationship?'

74
00:03:06,403 --> 00:03:08,078
Wow, good question.

75
00:03:08,175 --> 00:03:11,332
- You don't have to answer that.
- It's okay.

76
00:03:11,429 --> 00:03:15,005
Well, I was in a really crappy relationship
in college,

77
00:03:15,101 --> 00:03:18,645
and I wound up kissing this guy
at a party one night...

78
00:03:18,742 --> 00:03:23,748
and I felt terrible about it,
so I came clean and we broke up.

79
00:03:24,477 --> 00:03:27,570
Victoria, that was an honest
and mature answer.

80
00:03:27,666 --> 00:03:30,949
You may advance
to the Gumdrop Mountains.

81
00:03:31,436 --> 00:03:34,915
So, Victoria,
did you ever re-return to this guy?

82
00:03:35,011 --> 00:03:38,294
- What?
- You said what. You gotta drink.

83
00:03:39,296 --> 00:03:43,099
Oh, Barney, by the way, I went to a party
in that new building on 82nd,

84
00:03:43,195 --> 00:03:44,741
and the host said she knew you.

85
00:03:44,838 --> 00:03:48,613
- What is her name? Sharon? Shannon?
- Shannon?

86
00:03:48,769 --> 00:03:50,700
Shannon, Shannon.

87
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:53,182
No. Don't remember any Shannon.

88
00:03:53,279 --> 00:03:55,824
Really? Well, 'cause she gave me
a videotape to give you.

89
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,852
Where's the tape?

90
00:04:00,012 --> 00:04:01,333
I'll get it.

91
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:03,717
Cool. Okay. You know, whenever.

92
00:04:03,772 --> 00:04:06,089
Okay, Robin. Your roll.

93
00:04:07,863 --> 00:04:11,015
Five! Another 'Autobiography.'

94
00:04:11,697 --> 00:04:15,390
For the player to your left which...
Victoria!

95
00:04:15,402 --> 00:04:17,142
Of course.

96
00:04:17,238 --> 00:04:18,785
Victoria.

97
00:04:18,882 --> 00:04:23,069
'How many boyfriends did you have
before you started dating Ted?'

98
00:04:23,166 --> 00:04:24,906
Wait, the card actually says Ted?

99
00:04:25,002 --> 00:04:28,708
Okay. Well, boyfriends,
I guess I've only had two.

100
00:04:28,805 --> 00:04:30,736
Prude-alert.

101
00:04:31,092 --> 00:04:35,377
Well, that... That's serious boyfriends.
I've dated other guys in between.

102
00:04:35,474 --> 00:04:37,405
Oh, slut-alert!

103
00:04:40,757 --> 00:04:45,025
Oh, great, there it is.
Thanks, Lily, you're a peach.

104
00:04:52,130 --> 00:04:53,901
Well, wow, look at that.

105
00:04:53,998 --> 00:04:56,769
Robin landed on the Chocolate Swamp.
That's five chips for me.

106
00:04:56,866 --> 00:05:00,281
Thank you. Finally,
somebody understands Marshgammon.

107
00:05:00,377 --> 00:05:02,849
Barney, what was on that tape?

108
00:05:03,212 --> 00:05:05,564
- Too bad you'll never find out.
- Damn it!

109
00:05:05,661 --> 00:05:09,850
If only I'd given you a fake tape
and hidden the real tape in my purse.

110
00:05:09,946 --> 00:05:12,202
Oh, wait. That's exactly what I did.

111
00:05:12,298 --> 00:05:14,229
- What?
- Drink.

112
00:05:14,489 --> 00:05:19,515
Yeah, you were acting so weird about it
I gave you Ted's graduation tape instead.

113
00:05:19,611 --> 00:05:22,381
- So, should we pop it in?
- Give it to me.

114
00:05:22,478 --> 00:05:23,413
- Hey, hey!
- Ted!

115
00:05:23,509 --> 00:05:25,797
- Play it. Play it!
- Fine, fine.

116
00:05:25,893 --> 00:05:27,824
I cannot believe...

117
00:05:30,165 --> 00:05:32,933
<i>Shannon! I love you.</i>

118
00:05:33,902 --> 00:05:35,833
<i>I love you so much.</i>

119
00:05:37,639 --> 00:05:40,765
<i>What about us
changing the world together?</i>

120
00:05:40,861 --> 00:05:44,801
<i>Don't tell me you've forgotten.
I know I haven't.</i>

121
00:06:20,254 --> 00:06:22,896
- Did you try his cell phone?
- Yeah, I left two messages.

122
00:06:22,992 --> 00:06:27,503
I checked the cigar club,
the Lusty Leopard. He's off the grid.

123
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,178
Hey, guys. What up?

124
00:06:29,275 --> 00:06:32,336
- Barney, where have you been?
- Yeah, we're really sorry about that.

125
00:06:32,432 --> 00:06:34,363
Yeah, so sorry.

126
00:06:34,832 --> 00:06:37,152
But seriously, what was up with the tape?

127
00:06:37,249 --> 00:06:38,794
- No. Stay.
- Come on. Come on.

128
00:06:38,891 --> 00:06:41,018
- Stay. Come on.
- I'm sorry. I don't wanna talk about it.

129
00:06:41,115 --> 00:06:43,273
It was the most embarrassing
and humiliating thing...

130
00:06:43,369 --> 00:06:44,497
that ever happened to me.

131
00:06:44,594 --> 00:06:48,073
Well, we all have embarrassing stories.
Sometimes it's good to talk about it.

132
00:06:48,170 --> 00:06:49,330
Oh, really?

133
00:06:49,426 --> 00:06:52,390
Then why don't you tell us
your most humiliating moment, Marshall?

134
00:06:52,487 --> 00:06:54,418
Show me how good it is.

135
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:58,120
All right.

136
00:06:58,216 --> 00:07:01,019
<i>I was stopping by Lily's
kindergarten class to say hi,</i>

137
00:07:01,116 --> 00:07:02,952
<i>but they were all at recess.</i>

138
00:07:03,049 --> 00:07:06,464
<i>I really had to pee,
so I went into the class's restroom.</i>

139
00:07:06,561 --> 00:07:09,932
<i>It was a smaller target than I'm used to,</i>

140
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:12,585
<i>so I figured I should sit down.</i>

141
00:07:13,584 --> 00:07:17,322
<i>What I didn't realize was
it was a shared bathroom.</i>

142
00:07:21,316 --> 00:07:23,475
<i>I wish I'd pulled up my pants.</i>

143
00:07:28,719 --> 00:07:31,591
The kids still call him Funny Butt.

144
00:07:33,358 --> 00:07:35,929
Okay. I'll tell you my story.

145
00:07:36,838 --> 00:07:41,478
Believe it or not, I was not always
as awesome as I am today.

146
00:07:41,574 --> 00:07:44,441
<i>It was 1998.
I was just out of college,</i>

147
00:07:44,538 --> 00:07:47,019
<i>and I was working at a coffeehouse
with my girlfriend.</i>

148
00:07:47,116 --> 00:07:49,104
<i>My girlfriend, Shannon.</i>

149
00:07:59,404 --> 00:08:01,335
<i>Thank you.</i>

150
00:08:04,269 --> 00:08:05,493
All right.

151
00:08:05,589 --> 00:08:08,908
- I love your singing, Barney.
- And I love you, Shannon.

152
00:08:10,229 --> 00:08:12,774
Joining the Peace Corps with you
is gonna be legendary.

153
00:08:12,871 --> 00:08:17,317
I know. Only five short weeks,
till we're down in Nicaragua.

154
00:08:17,414 --> 00:08:19,402
Hey, nonfat latte to go.

155
00:08:20,023 --> 00:08:22,649
Mellow order, bro, mellow order.

156
00:08:24,018 --> 00:08:27,401
Dude. That's your G-friend?
All right, high-five.

157
00:08:27,498 --> 00:08:29,878
Sorry, I only give high-twos.

158
00:08:30,816 --> 00:08:33,748
Whatevs. As long as you're nailing that.

159
00:08:33,844 --> 00:08:35,931
Listen to you.'That'?

160
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:39,805
You know, women aren't objects.
They're human beings.

161
00:08:39,901 --> 00:08:42,768
And FYI, Shannon and I have
decided to wait till we're married.

162
00:08:42,865 --> 00:08:45,282
You can read about it in my zine.

163
00:08:45,378 --> 00:08:46,639
Hey, Haircut, right here.

164
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,735
Open up your knowledge basket
'cause here it comes.

165
00:08:48,831 --> 00:08:49,992
Forget all that touchy-feely crap.

166
00:08:50,089 --> 00:08:52,601
You get money, you get laid.
End of discussion.

167
00:08:52,698 --> 00:08:54,831
I feel sorry for you, man.

168
00:08:55,050 --> 00:08:56,854
<i>Peace out, hombre.</i>

169
00:08:58,723 --> 00:09:00,654
Suits.

170
00:09:01,622 --> 00:09:04,715
<i>Five weeks later, we were all set
to leave for the Peace Corps.</i>

171
00:09:04,811 --> 00:09:06,743
<i>Only problem was...</i>

172
00:09:07,421 --> 00:09:09,352
<i>she never showed up.</i>

173
00:09:14,998 --> 00:09:18,527
- She never showed?
- So what happened next?

174
00:09:19,799 --> 00:09:21,346
You know what? This was a mistake.

175
00:09:21,442 --> 00:09:25,082
Wait, what if somebody else
told their most humiliating story?

176
00:09:25,179 --> 00:09:27,531
Oh, I know just how to decide who.

177
00:09:27,628 --> 00:09:29,271
You brought the game to the bar?

178
00:09:29,367 --> 00:09:31,397
We're not quitting
just 'cause Ted's so far ahead.

179
00:09:31,494 --> 00:09:33,425
I was winning?

180
00:09:37,339 --> 00:09:39,270
Fine. I'll go next.

181
00:09:39,272 --> 00:09:42,559
<i>I was doing a report on live TV
about a hansom cab driver.</i>

182
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:46,392
- The slipping-in-horse-poop story?
- Yeah, we all know that one.

183
00:09:46,489 --> 00:09:47,971
Okay, how about this?

184
00:09:48,067 --> 00:09:50,516
I will tell you my most humiliating story.

185
00:09:50,613 --> 00:09:52,739
Yeah, Victoria. Way to step up.

186
00:09:52,835 --> 00:09:55,790
It involves a game of Truth or Dare,

187
00:09:55,832 --> 00:09:58,699
a squeeze bottle
of marshmallow ice cream topping,

188
00:09:58,796 --> 00:10:02,083
and the hot tub at my grandparents'
retirement community.

189
00:10:02,179 --> 00:10:04,305
<i>Kids, I tell you
a lot of inappropriate stories,</i>

190
00:10:04,402 --> 00:10:06,624
<i>but there's no way in hell
I'm telling you this one.</i>

191
00:10:06,721 --> 00:10:08,429
<i>Don't worry, though, it wasn't that great.</i>

192
00:10:09,317 --> 00:10:13,084
That is the greatest story ever!

193
00:10:13,183 --> 00:10:15,819
- Oh, my God!
- Wow, wow, wow!

194
00:10:16,566 --> 00:10:19,884
Victoria, I deem your offering worthy.

195
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:24,291
My saga continues.

196
00:10:25,232 --> 00:10:28,196
<i>I went back to the coffeehouse
to find Shannon.</i>

197
00:10:28,293 --> 00:10:31,192
- Barney!
- Sugar bear, where were you?

198
00:10:31,289 --> 00:10:34,309
I'm sorry. My dad won't let me go.

199
00:10:34,962 --> 00:10:37,400
But the Nicaraguans need us.

200
00:10:37,507 --> 00:10:39,794
It's just he's still supporting me.

201
00:10:39,891 --> 00:10:42,243
And, look,
he's coming by soon to talk about it,

202
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:45,271
but I think you should go on without me.

203
00:10:45,368 --> 00:10:47,430
- Shannon, there is no...
- Barney.

204
00:10:47,527 --> 00:10:49,234
It's your dream.

205
00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:52,859
It's only two years. I know we can make it.

206
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:59,135
<i>As I walked away,
I realized Shannon was an adult.</i>

207
00:10:59,232 --> 00:11:01,519
<i>Her father couldn't control her life.</i>

208
00:11:01,616 --> 00:11:04,406
<i>I had to go back and confront him.</i>

209
00:11:07,705 --> 00:11:12,219
<i>She was in the middle
of a heated argument with her dad.</i>

210
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,690
What?

211
00:11:21,655 --> 00:11:23,586
Now we all gotta drink.

212
00:11:26,444 --> 00:11:28,989
Oh, my God. What happened next?

213
00:11:29,762 --> 00:11:32,881
- Oh, I don't know, guys.
- Okay, okay.

214
00:11:32,952 --> 00:11:35,659
- Marshall's mom sent us cookies.
- Lily, no! No, Lily!

215
00:11:35,755 --> 00:11:38,792
For the team, Marshall, for the team.

216
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,974
Hey, Mrs. Eriksen, it's Lily.

217
00:11:41,071 --> 00:11:44,600
Thank you so much
for the delicious cookies.

218
00:11:44,679 --> 00:11:46,610
Mayonnaise. Really?

219
00:11:47,063 --> 00:11:48,706
Never would have guessed.

220
00:11:48,803 --> 00:11:51,767
Yes, well I will definitely give Marshall
a kiss for you.

221
00:11:51,864 --> 00:11:53,249
Okay, take care.

222
00:11:53,346 --> 00:11:56,875
- Hi, baby.
- Oh, crap! My mom sent cookies?

223
00:11:57,115 --> 00:12:00,820
Yeah. I wish we had a dog,
so they wouldn't go to waste.

224
00:12:00,917 --> 00:12:02,173
Yeah.

225
00:12:02,269 --> 00:12:04,558
So, we've got the whole place to ourselves.

226
00:12:04,654 --> 00:12:08,389
- I'm thinking floor sex.
- Sounds reasonable.

227
00:12:10,582 --> 00:12:12,513
Oh, floor's cold.

228
00:12:13,159 --> 00:12:15,703
Grab that afghan your mom made.

229
00:12:17,509 --> 00:12:19,249
The whole time?

230
00:12:19,345 --> 00:12:22,399
The whole time.

231
00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:25,885
Barney, that was really embarrassing
for both of us.

232
00:12:25,982 --> 00:12:28,172
We just earned a huge chunk of story.

233
00:12:28,269 --> 00:12:30,224
Right. So where was I?

234
00:12:30,686 --> 00:12:34,543
Oh, yeah.
Shannon was sucking face with her dad.

235
00:12:41,615 --> 00:12:43,899
How could... With your dad?

236
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,432
I mean, I know,
judge not lest ye be judged, but gross!

237
00:12:48,510 --> 00:12:50,540
Barney, that's not my dad.

238
00:12:50,636 --> 00:12:52,892
His name's Greg.
I've been seeing him for a few weeks.

239
00:12:52,988 --> 00:12:57,144
I was hoping you'd just leave
and we could avoid all this.

240
00:12:57,241 --> 00:13:00,269
We're breaking up?
But what about the Peace Corps?

241
00:13:00,366 --> 00:13:04,071
Yeah, all this granola business,
it was just a phase.

242
00:13:04,167 --> 00:13:06,903
Greg's older. He's successful.

243
00:13:07,293 --> 00:13:09,837
He buys me all this cool stuff.

244
00:13:10,772 --> 00:13:13,957
- But I love you.
- But he has a boat.

245
00:13:15,627 --> 00:13:19,977
You should go to the Peace Corps.
And forget about me.

246
00:13:23,263 --> 00:13:25,194
<i>I didn't go.</i>

247
00:13:25,293 --> 00:13:28,740
<i>That night, I recorded my video
and mailed it to Shannon.</i>

248
00:13:28,836 --> 00:13:31,639
<i>I didn't see her until a week later.</i>

249
00:13:31,736 --> 00:13:34,034
There's sugar in the basket.

250
00:13:35,892 --> 00:13:38,340
Shannon! Shannon, you came back!

251
00:13:38,437 --> 00:13:41,369
I'm just picking up my last paycheck.

252
00:13:41,466 --> 00:13:44,486
Did you... Did you get my tape?

253
00:13:45,171 --> 00:13:47,102
Oh, she got the tape.

254
00:13:47,684 --> 00:13:51,023
You? You... It was you?

255
00:13:55,899 --> 00:13:57,830
Oh, man!

256
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:12,953
Oh, you poor thing.

257
00:15:13,050 --> 00:15:16,625
The story's not over.
I did see Shannon one more time.

258
00:15:16,722 --> 00:15:18,973
- When?
- Sorry. Sorry.

259
00:15:21,071 --> 00:15:23,123
Oh, you've gotta tell us.

260
00:15:23,133 --> 00:15:28,878
I don't know. I think I might need
one last story to get me through it.

261
00:15:29,737 --> 00:15:31,059
Fine.

262
00:15:31,156 --> 00:15:32,766
Oh, the Green Testicles story.

263
00:15:32,863 --> 00:15:34,828
So, I was playing Ultimate Frisbee
in college,

264
00:15:34,924 --> 00:15:37,309
and there was this barefoot dude
with a weirdly sharp toenail...

265
00:15:37,406 --> 00:15:40,788
Oh, come on, Ted!
You know what story I wanna hear.

266
00:15:40,885 --> 00:15:43,721
Everyone else here has manned-up tonight
and told the truth.

267
00:15:43,817 --> 00:15:45,748
Why can't you?

268
00:15:46,491 --> 00:15:48,422
You're right.

269
00:15:48,553 --> 00:15:52,032
Victoria, I'm sorry I haven't
told you this yet, but a while back,

270
00:15:52,129 --> 00:15:54,830
I was kind of into Robin.

271
00:15:55,995 --> 00:16:00,673
In fact, on our first date,
I might've said, 'I love you.'

272
00:16:01,472 --> 00:16:04,339
Understandably, she freaked out,
and I left,

273
00:16:04,436 --> 00:16:08,211
but unfortunately,
the night did not end there.

274
00:16:10,106 --> 00:16:13,038
<i>We all ended up at the bar
with our cabdriver, Ranjit.</i>

275
00:16:13,134 --> 00:16:15,065
To one hell of a night!

276
00:16:17,774 --> 00:16:19,159
<i>And I drank.</i>

277
00:16:19,256 --> 00:16:20,448
<i>A lot.</i>

278
00:16:23,285 --> 00:16:26,121
So, you guys think
I should have kissed her?

279
00:16:26,217 --> 00:16:30,984
Well, I'll tell you what.
I'm gonna go kiss her. Right now.

280
00:16:31,082 --> 00:16:33,103
Yes! Do it!

281
00:16:33,208 --> 00:16:34,497
To the car.

282
00:16:51,445 --> 00:16:54,318
Hello? Is someone out there?

283
00:17:03,431 --> 00:17:05,362
You ralphed and ran?

284
00:17:05,943 --> 00:17:08,714
I thought you were vomit-free since '93.

285
00:17:08,811 --> 00:17:10,742
So, that was a lie?

286
00:17:11,646 --> 00:17:15,248
You re-returned for me.
That's really sweet.

287
00:17:15,931 --> 00:17:18,959
Though you kind of ruined
my customized Scherbatsky doormat.

288
00:17:19,055 --> 00:17:20,987
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

289
00:17:22,697 --> 00:17:27,293
- Victoria, I know this must be...
- Yeah. It kind of is.

290
00:17:30,267 --> 00:17:34,069
Wow, Ted, you were right.
You shouldn't have told that story.

291
00:17:34,165 --> 00:17:37,001
But you did earn yourself
the right to the end of mine.

292
00:17:37,098 --> 00:17:39,546
We fast-forward eight years into the future.

293
00:17:39,643 --> 00:17:42,598
Wait, eight years. That's this year.

294
00:17:42,897 --> 00:17:46,836
Marshall, not only is it this year,
it's tonight.

295
00:17:55,650 --> 00:17:57,581
Hi.

296
00:17:58,453 --> 00:18:00,384
- Barney?
- Hi, Shannon.

297
00:18:01,416 --> 00:18:03,672
- What are you doing here?
- Just listen.

298
00:18:03,769 --> 00:18:07,055
When you left me for that guy Greg,
it changed me.

299
00:18:07,084 --> 00:18:09,015
Now, I'm this.

300
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:14,176
I know this is crazy, it's just,
you were once such a big part of my life,

301
00:18:14,273 --> 00:18:16,657
and it just seemed insane
that you didn't know who I am now.

302
00:18:16,753 --> 00:18:19,005
So, here I am.

303
00:18:20,941 --> 00:18:22,842
<i>And then she told me
about her life.</i>

304
00:18:22,939 --> 00:18:26,354
She and Greg dated for a while,
and then split up.

305
00:18:26,450 --> 00:18:29,801
But here's the real kicker.
Shannon's a mom.

306
00:18:29,897 --> 00:18:32,186
She has a little kid named Max.

307
00:18:32,282 --> 00:18:35,688
That's crazy. That could've been my kid.

308
00:18:36,985 --> 00:18:39,283
But instead, what do I have?

309
00:18:39,434 --> 00:18:42,527
My whole life's some money in the bank,
some suits in my closet,

310
00:18:42,623 --> 00:18:45,332
and a string of one-night stands.

311
00:18:46,489 --> 00:18:48,421
Hey, come on.

312
00:18:48,422 --> 00:18:50,162
I mean, just because her life went one way,

313
00:18:50,259 --> 00:18:54,855
and yours went another,
doesn't make your life any worse.

314
00:18:55,768 --> 00:18:57,700
My life rocks!

315
00:18:58,379 --> 00:19:01,990
Money, suits and sex.
These are tears of joy.

316
00:19:02,245 --> 00:19:04,661
I could be cooped up
in some tiny apartment,

317
00:19:04,757 --> 00:19:06,916
changing some brat's poopy diapers,

318
00:19:07,013 --> 00:19:10,653
but instead, I'm out in the world
being awesome 24/7, 365.

319
00:19:10,749 --> 00:19:13,622
You let me dodge a bullet, Big Guy.

320
00:19:13,649 --> 00:19:17,064
Plus, here's the mini-cherry,
on top of the regular cherry,

321
00:19:17,161 --> 00:19:19,674
on top of the sundae of awesomeness
that is my life.

322
00:19:19,771 --> 00:19:23,136
After Shannon and I talked, I nailed her.

323
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:24,539
- No.
- Yeah.

324
00:19:24,635 --> 00:19:25,634
- No.
- Yeah.

325
00:19:25,731 --> 00:19:27,761
Sorry, don't buy it. You're making it up.

326
00:19:27,857 --> 00:19:30,983
You're just trying to cover the fact
that you actually had a profound moment...

327
00:19:31,079 --> 00:19:32,271
of doubt about yourself and...

328
00:19:33,528 --> 00:19:35,686
<i>- Oh, my God.
- Oh, Barney, oh.</i>

329
00:19:35,782 --> 00:19:37,780
Video's pretty good on this phone, huh?

330
00:19:37,877 --> 00:19:38,940
<i>Is your phone on?</i>

331
00:19:39,036 --> 00:19:41,743
<i>Oh, no, it just takes a while
to power down.</i>

332
00:19:41,839 --> 00:19:43,860
Oh, gross. Just stop it.

333
00:19:45,877 --> 00:19:48,030
Ladies, gentlemen, Ted.

334
00:19:49,743 --> 00:19:51,322
This has been a wonderful evening.

335
00:19:51,418 --> 00:19:54,963
I got great dirt on all you guys.
I got Ted to tell the re-return.

336
00:19:55,059 --> 00:19:57,894
I finally nailed Shannon!
Told her I'd call her tomorrow.

337
00:19:57,991 --> 00:19:59,763
Yeah, right.

338
00:19:59,859 --> 00:20:03,371
And I rediscovered
just how awesomely awesome my life is.

339
00:20:03,467 --> 00:20:05,398
<i>Peace out, hombres.</i>

340
00:20:08,816 --> 00:20:11,688
I think Barney just won game night.

341
00:20:12,775 --> 00:20:16,222
<i>We spend so much effort
trying to keep parts of our lives hidden,</i>

342
00:20:16,318 --> 00:20:18,187
<i>even from our closest friends...</i>

343
00:20:18,283 --> 00:20:20,732
<i>that those rare times when we do open up,
</i>

344
00:20:20,829 --> 00:20:25,343
<i>it's amazing how minor those secrets
all end up seeming.</i>

345
00:20:31,525 --> 00:20:32,846
$100 says when you turn around...

346
00:20:32,942 --> 00:20:36,800
<i>Of course,
not every secret was told that night.</i>

347
00:20:36,823 --> 00:20:39,942
<i>But that's getting ahead of the story.</i>
