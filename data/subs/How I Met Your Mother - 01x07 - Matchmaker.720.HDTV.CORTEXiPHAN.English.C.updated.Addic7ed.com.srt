00:00:12,869 --> 00:00:14,527
Kids, before I met your mother,

3
00:00:14,623 --> 00:00:17,874
when I was still out there searching,
I learned something valuable.

4
00:00:17,969 --> 00:00:19,564
That love is not a science.

5
00:00:19,659 --> 00:00:22,114
- Wow, that was a great story, Dad.
- We're gonna go watch TV.

6
00:00:22,210 --> 00:00:24,473
You see, sometimes in life...

7
00:00:24,568 --> 00:00:27,086
you just have to accept
that certain things can't be explained,

8
00:00:27,182 --> 00:00:29,212
and that's kind of scary.

9
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,888
- Oh, my God.
- I know, I'm still shaking.

10
00:00:32,984 --> 00:00:35,598
What the... Joke's on you. I have a cold.

11
00:00:35,693 --> 00:00:36,968
Are you guys okay?

12
00:00:37,065 --> 00:00:38,657
Another round,
and back it up for me and Lily!

13
00:00:38,754 --> 00:00:39,837
What happened?

14
00:00:39,933 --> 00:00:44,481
- We saw something, up in the apartment.
- Something bad.

15
00:00:49,082 --> 00:00:52,015
I don't know what it is,
but margaritas make me sexy.

16
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:55,683
<i>Oh, mucho sexy. Te
quiero, Marshall.</i>

17
00:00:58,613 --> 00:01:00,523
Oh, my God!

18
00:01:04,255 --> 00:01:05,275
What was it?

19
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:08,431
Only the craziest, meanest-looking mouse
you've ever seen.

20
00:01:08,527 --> 00:01:13,117
Mouse? Sweetie, that wasn't a mouse.
That was a huge cockroach.

21
00:01:13,213 --> 00:01:15,572
Baby, it was a mouse. It had whiskers.

22
00:01:15,667 --> 00:01:18,567
What, those things coming out
of his head? Those were antennae.

23
00:01:18,663 --> 00:01:22,137
- Marshall ran away from a cockroach.
- It was a mouse.

24
00:01:22,233 --> 00:01:24,911
Oh, yeah, sorry, my bad. You're a man.

25
00:01:25,006 --> 00:01:28,450
My story's on. Ted, pay attention.
Carl, turn it up.

26
00:01:28,545 --> 00:01:29,661
<i>I'm here with Ellen Pierce,</i>

27
00:01:29,756 --> 00:01:31,955
<i>New York's premiere matchmaker.</i>

28
00:01:32,051 --> 00:01:36,260
<i>Ellen, your company 'Love Solutions'
boasts a 100% success rate.</i>

29
00:01:36,355 --> 00:01:38,872
<i>- What's your secret?
- Science.</i>

30
00:01:38,873 --> 00:01:42,890
Everything in life can be broken down
to ones and zeros, even love.

31
00:01:42,985 --> 00:01:46,491
All I have to do is input
the variables, run the algorithm,

32
00:01:46,587 --> 00:01:50,317
and presto manifesto,
you have a soul mate and it works!

33
00:01:50,412 --> 00:01:53,400
Just ask all of my happy couples.

34
00:01:53,696 --> 00:01:55,704
And these are just
the attractive ones.

35
00:01:55,799 --> 00:01:58,317
I have more photos in the bathroom.

36
00:01:58,413 --> 00:02:00,613
Love Solutions' Ellen Pierce.

37
00:02:00,709 --> 00:02:03,098
A beacon of hope
for New York City's lovelorn.

38
00:02:03,195 --> 00:02:04,310
<i>Robin Scherbatsky...</i>

39
00:02:04,406 --> 00:02:05,809
Was that chick at the end really a client?

40
00:02:05,904 --> 00:02:07,021
- Yes.
- We're signing up.

41
00:02:07,638 --> 00:02:10,315
- What?
- Ted, these chicks are desperate and hot.

42
00:02:10,411 --> 00:02:14,555
That's a perfect cocktail.
Shake well, then sleep with.

43
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:17,647
I'm not going to a matchmaker.
That's like giving up.

44
00:02:17,743 --> 00:02:19,942
It's the man version of getting a cat.

45
00:02:20,037 --> 00:02:23,736
No, it wasn't a cockroach. It had fur.
And only mammals have fur.

46
00:02:23,831 --> 00:02:24,883
It was a cockroach.

47
00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:27,146
Come on, Lily.
The only way that that was a cockroach...

48
00:02:27,242 --> 00:02:31,195
is if it was wearing the skin
of a mouse it just killed.

49
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:33,201
Oh, my God!

50
00:02:34,127 --> 00:02:36,038
Come on!

51
00:02:45,953 --> 00:02:48,567
Ted! Hurry!
You got to help me, my boat is sinking.

52
00:02:48,662 --> 00:02:49,842
- What?
- My boat is sinking!

53
00:02:49,937 --> 00:02:51,341
- You have a boat?
- Yes, I bought a boat last year...

54
00:02:51,436 --> 00:02:53,827
at a police auction. I just got a call
from a guy down at the marina...

55
00:02:53,923 --> 00:02:55,325
that it's leaning starboard
at a 45-degree angle.

56
00:02:55,421 --> 00:03:00,426
If I don't get down there right now
it's gonna capsize! Now come on!

57
00:03:00,521 --> 00:03:03,008
Your boat is sinking. That was good.

58
00:03:03,103 --> 00:03:05,972
Come on.
Ted, this is an incredible opportunity.

59
00:03:06,068 --> 00:03:11,184
We'll meet our soul mates, nail them,
and never call them again.

60
00:03:11,455 --> 00:03:13,272
All finished, gentlemen?

61
00:03:13,368 --> 00:03:16,332
Congratulations, you have just taken
your very first step.

62
00:03:16,427 --> 00:03:19,393
Gosh, thanks, Ellen.
I sure hope this works.

63
00:03:19,488 --> 00:03:24,174
I'm so done with the single life.
All the games, the meaningless sex.

64
00:03:24,269 --> 00:03:26,180
You deserve more.

65
00:03:26,437 --> 00:03:28,697
That is so true, Ellen.

66
00:03:29,241 --> 00:03:34,087
I really think I'm ready to stop
being a me, and start being a we.

67
00:03:34,183 --> 00:03:36,829
Hey, is there any way I can
let it be known that I love cuddling?

68
00:03:36,925 --> 00:03:40,327
Oh, of course you... That is so...

69
00:03:43,172 --> 00:03:45,691
It's kind of hard to talk about with Ted here,

70
00:03:45,786 --> 00:03:50,504
but I just want someone who's not afraid
to hold me at night,

71
00:03:50,599 --> 00:03:52,511
when the tears come.

72
00:03:53,532 --> 00:03:55,891
Ellen, can you help me find her?

73
00:03:55,987 --> 00:03:57,898
- Get out.
- What?

74
00:03:59,015 --> 00:04:01,246
I get 15 guys like you every week.

75
00:04:01,341 --> 00:04:03,414
Jerks who just wanna meet
vulnerable women,

76
00:04:03,509 --> 00:04:05,423
nail them, and never call them again.

77
00:04:05,518 --> 00:04:07,494
Oh, my God, people do that?

78
00:04:07,589 --> 00:04:09,694
Do you wanna do this the easy way,
or the hard way?

79
00:04:09,789 --> 00:04:12,945
What's the hard way?
Security roughs me up and tosses me out?

80
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,730
No, that's the easy way.

81
00:04:14,827 --> 00:04:17,981
The hard way is that I stomp the crap
out of you myself.

82
00:04:18,077 --> 00:04:21,488
- Okay, Ted, let's go.
- Not you. You stay.

83
00:04:22,413 --> 00:04:23,815
You're cute.

84
00:04:23,911 --> 00:04:26,301
You're an architect. Good career.

85
00:04:26,398 --> 00:04:28,979
And you didn't use an obvious alias
on your application...

86
00:04:29,074 --> 00:04:31,672
like your friend 'Jack Package.'

87
00:04:32,773 --> 00:04:36,347
- It's pronounced Puh-kaj.
- Get out of here!

88
00:04:36,758 --> 00:04:38,321
You, I can work with.

89
00:04:38,416 --> 00:04:43,613
You give me three days,
and I will find the woman you will marry.

90
00:04:44,345 --> 00:04:47,597
No, thanks.
I don't need an algorithm to meet women.

91
00:04:47,692 --> 00:04:50,816
It's New York City.
You know, plenty of fish in the sea.

92
00:04:50,912 --> 00:04:53,291
Plenty of fish in the sea.

93
00:04:53,398 --> 00:04:55,470
Yes, there's nine million people
in New York,

94
00:04:55,565 --> 00:04:57,533
4.5 million women.

95
00:04:57,637 --> 00:04:59,997
Of course, you wanna meet somebody
roughly your own age,

96
00:05:00,092 --> 00:05:02,037
let's say, plus-minus five years.

97
00:05:02,132 --> 00:05:04,524
So if we take into account
the most recent census data,

98
00:05:04,619 --> 00:05:07,423
that leaves us with 482,000.

99
00:05:07,519 --> 00:05:10,834
But wait, 48% of those
are already in relationships,

100
00:05:10,931 --> 00:05:13,672
and then you have to eliminate half
for intelligence, sense of humor...

101
00:05:13,767 --> 00:05:14,788
and compatibility.

102
00:05:14,883 --> 00:05:17,562
And then you have to take out
the ex-girlfriends, and the relatives...

103
00:05:17,657 --> 00:05:19,633
and, oh, we can't forget those lesbians.

104
00:05:19,728 --> 00:05:24,217
And then that leaves us with eight women.

105
00:05:25,849 --> 00:05:29,260
That can't be right. Eight? Really, eight?

106
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:33,499
There are eight fish
in that big, blue ocean, Ted.

107
00:05:33,594 --> 00:05:36,527
And if you feel confident
that you could reel one into your boat...

108
00:05:36,624 --> 00:05:38,978
without me, there's the door.

109
00:05:39,428 --> 00:05:41,459
Do you take credit cards?

110
00:05:43,603 --> 00:05:46,823
Okay, it's back.
And this time we got a good look.

111
00:05:46,918 --> 00:05:49,565
Hey. Seriously,
you have to stop doing that!

112
00:05:49,661 --> 00:05:52,503
It's bigger now. It's been feeding.

113
00:05:54,346 --> 00:05:56,451
We were just upstairs watching TV.

114
00:05:56,546 --> 00:05:58,456
Oh, gosh.

115
00:06:05,248 --> 00:06:07,606
Okay. Let's do this.

116
00:06:18,031 --> 00:06:20,030
It's okay. It's over.

117
00:06:30,749 --> 00:06:32,758
- So, did you get a good look at it?
- Yeah.

118
00:06:32,854 --> 00:06:36,897
It has six legs, a hard exoskeleton,
like a roach.

119
00:06:36,998 --> 00:06:39,548
But it had mouse-like characteristics.

120
00:06:39,644 --> 00:06:42,129
Gray-brown tufts of fur, a tail.

121
00:06:42,225 --> 00:06:45,392
So which is it, a cockroach or a mouse?

122
00:06:46,847 --> 00:06:48,759
It's a cockamouse.

123
00:06:50,457 --> 00:06:51,604
What?

124
00:06:51,699 --> 00:06:54,473
It's some sort of mutant combination
of the two.

125
00:06:54,568 --> 00:06:58,351
It's as if a cockroach and a mouse,
you know...

126
00:06:58,617 --> 00:07:02,124
Did the horizontal, 10-legged,
inter-species cha-cha?

127
00:07:02,219 --> 00:07:04,897
That's impossible.
That simply can't happen.

128
00:07:04,993 --> 00:07:06,300
- But it can.
- And it has.

129
00:07:06,395 --> 00:07:08,305
And it's pissed.

130
00:07:10,125 --> 00:07:12,102
Dude, is everything okay?
You left the front door open.

131
00:07:12,197 --> 00:07:14,107
There was no time.

132
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:18,317
So, Love Solutions?
Did you meet the love of your life?

133
00:07:18,412 --> 00:07:21,664
She said it'd take three days.
It's been five days.

134
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:22,716
Should I be worried?

135
00:07:22,812 --> 00:07:26,031
Just play it cool. Don't Ted out about it.

136
00:07:26,127 --> 00:07:28,709
Did you just use my name as a verb?

137
00:07:28,804 --> 00:07:30,972
Yeah, we do that behind your back.

138
00:07:31,068 --> 00:07:32,821
Ted out. To overthink.

139
00:07:32,916 --> 00:07:34,828
Also see, Ted up.

140
00:07:34,829 --> 00:07:37,571
Ted up, to overthink something
with disastrous results.

141
00:07:37,667 --> 00:07:40,025
Sample sentence,
Billy Teded up when he tried to...

142
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:42,031
Okay. I get it.

143
00:07:42,097 --> 00:07:45,572
Don't worry. I'm not gonna
Ted anything up, or out.

144
00:07:45,668 --> 00:07:48,347
I should give it a few more days.

145
00:07:48,887 --> 00:07:52,549
- Hi, Ellen. Remember me? I'm Ted.
- Ted. Hi.

146
00:07:52,648 --> 00:07:54,019
I meant to call you.

147
00:07:54,114 --> 00:07:56,283
The computer is still crunching
the numbers.

148
00:07:56,378 --> 00:07:58,259
Busy as a bee, that little computer.

149
00:07:58,355 --> 00:07:59,852
You said it was gonna be three days.

150
00:07:59,948 --> 00:08:01,574
Did I? Three days.

151
00:08:01,670 --> 00:08:02,626
- Really?
- Yeah.

152
00:08:02,721 --> 00:08:05,590
When someone says you're gonna meet
the perfect woman in three days,

153
00:08:05,685 --> 00:08:08,269
you kind of put that in your datebook. So.

154
00:08:08,364 --> 00:08:11,997
How do I say this?
This is gonna be really hard.

155
00:08:12,093 --> 00:08:16,316
Ted, there are absolutely no women
out there for you.

156
00:08:17,288 --> 00:08:20,049
Actually, I got through that okay.

157
00:08:23,141 --> 00:08:25,596
There are no women out there for me?
I thought you said there were eight.

158
00:08:25,692 --> 00:08:27,987
I know. There's supposed to be.
I don't know where they are.

159
00:08:28,084 --> 00:08:30,505
But I'm an architect.
And you said I'm cute.

160
00:08:30,602 --> 00:08:32,769
- I'm a cute architect.
- How do you think I feel?

161
00:08:32,864 --> 00:08:36,364
I have a 100% success rate.
That's my hook!

162
00:08:36,466 --> 00:08:38,762
I could maybe find somebody for you
if you were gay.

163
00:08:38,858 --> 00:08:40,324
- Well, I'm not.
- A little bi maybe?

164
00:08:40,419 --> 00:08:42,330
No!

165
00:08:42,650 --> 00:08:46,349
- You're messing with me, right?
- Come see for yourself.

166
00:08:46,444 --> 00:08:48,379
I cannot set you up...

167
00:08:48,484 --> 00:08:52,341
unless you have a compatibility rating
of 7.0 or higher. And look.

168
00:08:52,436 --> 00:08:55,144
5.4, 4.8, 5.6...

169
00:08:55,242 --> 00:08:56,868
There's a 9.6 right there.

170
00:08:56,963 --> 00:08:58,994
Don't touch the computer.

171
00:09:00,087 --> 00:09:02,892
Yes. Sarah O'Brien.
I fixed her up six months ago.

172
00:09:02,988 --> 00:09:05,283
She would've been
absolutely perfect for you.

173
00:09:05,379 --> 00:09:08,311
Well, what about the guy you set her
up with? Is he a 9.6 compatibility rating?

174
00:09:08,406 --> 00:09:10,192
- 8.5.
- So he sucks!

175
00:09:10,287 --> 00:09:14,023
No, 8.5 is an extremely good
match-up quotient.

176
00:09:14,144 --> 00:09:17,991
Sure it's good. It's solid. But a 9.6?

177
00:09:18,097 --> 00:09:21,833
9.6 is off the charts.
But Sarah is matched up.

178
00:09:22,369 --> 00:09:25,488
Ted, look. I have lunch. Please.

179
00:09:25,716 --> 00:09:29,031
I promise we will find you somebody.
Don't lose hope.

180
00:09:29,127 --> 00:09:32,375
There are new women turning 18
every day.

181
00:09:58,772 --> 00:10:01,801
It's a whole new species. The cockamouse.

182
00:10:01,896 --> 00:10:05,179
And it's the size of a potato.

183
00:10:06,932 --> 00:10:10,497
So, what now, it's a cockapotatomouse?

184
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:14,328
Don't make it sound ridiculous.
It's a cockamouse!

185
00:10:14,423 --> 00:10:17,261
My God, this is incredible!
We're like the same person.

186
00:10:17,357 --> 00:10:20,799
Sarah O'Brien loves brunch.
She wants to have two children.

187
00:10:20,894 --> 00:10:24,082
<i>Her guilty-pleasure song
is Summer Breezeby Seals and Croft.</i>

188
00:10:24,709 --> 00:10:28,444
Wow, Ted.
Sounds like you're her perfect woman.

189
00:10:28,534 --> 00:10:32,519
And like the majestic seahorse,
it's hermaphroditic.

190
00:10:32,614 --> 00:10:36,058
Obviously, the whole thing
is shrouded in mystery.

191
00:10:36,153 --> 00:10:38,383
For as much as we know
about the cockamouse,

192
00:10:38,479 --> 00:10:41,189
there is still so much we don't know.

193
00:10:41,285 --> 00:10:44,313
Well, we know that there is no such thing
as the cockamouse.

194
00:10:44,409 --> 00:10:48,106
What we don't know
is what you guys have been smoking.

195
00:10:48,202 --> 00:10:50,274
So you really don't believe
in the cockamouse?

196
00:10:50,369 --> 00:10:53,048
Well, I believe that you saw
something perfectly normal,

197
00:10:53,143 --> 00:10:59,314
but you've exaggerated it in your mind,
you know, like the Loch Ness monster.

198
00:10:59,868 --> 00:11:04,172
If by 'like the Loch Ness monster'
you mean 'totally exists and is awesome,'

199
00:11:04,268 --> 00:11:07,520
then, yeah, it's like the Loch Ness monster.

200
00:11:07,615 --> 00:11:10,611
Its diet is not unlike our own.
Grains, cereals,

201
00:11:10,706 --> 00:11:13,385
- and it's awfully fond of cheese.
- Okay. This is getting weird.

202
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:14,882
The similarities go on and on.

203
00:11:14,979 --> 00:11:18,485
She hates phonies.
I totally hate phonies, too.

204
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:21,226
She's a dermatologist. I have skin.

205
00:11:21,322 --> 00:11:24,064
You want to be her boyfriend.
She already has a boyfriend.

206
00:11:24,159 --> 00:11:26,669
- It's uncanny.
- All right.

207
00:11:26,963 --> 00:11:28,366
But it wouldn't hurt to check her out, right?

208
00:11:28,462 --> 00:11:32,128
See what my 9.6 looks like in person,
as, you know, a frame of reference.

209
00:11:32,224 --> 00:11:36,304
And if she thinks she can do
11.45% better, who am I to deny her that?

210
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:39,648
<i>That's right, I did the math.</i>

211
00:11:42,456 --> 00:11:44,835
- Hi.
- Hi, I'm Dr. O'Brien.

212
00:11:44,943 --> 00:11:48,799
I'm architect Mosby. Sorry.
I just wanted to say my job, too.

213
00:11:48,894 --> 00:11:50,680
- Hi, I'm Ted.
- Hi.

214
00:11:50,776 --> 00:11:52,083
So, what are we doing today?

215
00:11:52,178 --> 00:11:54,697
Right, I have a kind of mole on my back.

216
00:11:54,792 --> 00:11:56,833
It's probably nothing.
But I'm a cautious guy.

217
00:11:56,928 --> 00:11:58,838
I'm exactly the same.

218
00:12:13,345 --> 00:12:17,552
<i>Sorry about that. Summer Breeze
is my guilty-pleasure song.</i>

219
00:12:17,648 --> 00:12:20,707
Oh, yeah, it's been stuck in my head
ever since I heard it this weekend...

220
00:12:20,804 --> 00:12:24,020
- at brunch.
- I love brunch.

221
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:25,712
It's the best.

222
00:12:25,809 --> 00:12:29,188
As long as I don't have to spend it
with a bunch of phonies.

223
00:12:29,885 --> 00:12:33,295
I like the way you think, architect Mosby.

224
00:12:33,965 --> 00:12:36,675
Hey, this may sound weird.
But it'll definitely sound more weird...

225
00:12:36,770 --> 00:12:38,938
once my shirt's off,
so I'm gonna ask you now.

226
00:12:39,033 --> 00:12:42,095
Do you wanna have dinner with me
Saturday night?

227
00:12:42,190 --> 00:12:47,305
That's very sweet, but I'm actually
getting married on Saturday.

228
00:12:47,991 --> 00:12:49,901
Friday night?

229
00:12:51,525 --> 00:12:54,203
Wow. You're getting married.
Congratulations.

230
00:12:54,299 --> 00:12:56,658
- Thank you.
- I'm really sorry I asked you out.

231
00:12:56,753 --> 00:12:59,495
It just felt like there could
be this weird connection between us.

232
00:12:59,591 --> 00:13:02,714
- How crazy am I coming off here?
- Only a little.

233
00:13:02,810 --> 00:13:07,145
Well, by some million-to-one long shot,
and I'm not rooting for this,

234
00:13:07,241 --> 00:13:11,321
you wind up not getting married
this weekend, give me a call.

235
00:13:11,416 --> 00:13:15,883
Okay. But it's not likely.
I look damn good in my dress.

236
00:13:15,911 --> 00:13:17,823
I'm sure you do.

237
00:13:21,171 --> 00:13:24,419
Wow. That's a pretty sophisticated trap.

238
00:13:24,454 --> 00:13:26,335
You think the Road Runner's
gonna fall for it?

239
00:13:26,431 --> 00:13:30,512
Okay, we get it. You're skeptical.
But Marshall and I, we're believers.

240
00:13:30,607 --> 00:13:31,531
We believe.

241
00:13:31,626 --> 00:13:34,687
Yeah, look around.
The universe is mysterious and awesome.

242
00:13:34,783 --> 00:13:37,874
You got the Bermuda Triangle,
ghosts, Bigfoot.

243
00:13:37,970 --> 00:13:41,093
Bad maps, creaky houses,
hillbilly in a gorilla suit.

244
00:13:41,189 --> 00:13:42,688
Aliens?

245
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:45,269
Come on! You gotta give me aliens!

246
00:13:45,365 --> 00:13:49,031
Stonehenge, Area 51,
there's alien crap all over the place.

247
00:13:49,128 --> 00:13:51,224
You can't be serious?

248
00:13:51,326 --> 00:13:54,168
My friend, you just poked the bear.

249
00:13:55,343 --> 00:13:57,505
So, my 9.6,

250
00:13:57,606 --> 00:14:01,016
beautiful, charming, intelligent, engaged.

251
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:05,001
- Oh, Ted, I'm so sorry.
- Yeah, it was a long shot.

252
00:14:05,097 --> 00:14:08,029
I told her to call me anyway if she
changes her mind. But I don't know.

253
00:14:08,125 --> 00:14:11,090
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Let's not skip over this.

254
00:14:11,185 --> 00:14:14,692
Raise your hand if earlier today
you hit on an engaged woman?

255
00:14:18,783 --> 00:14:20,855
Come on, Lily, don't hate the player,
hate the game.

256
00:14:20,950 --> 00:14:25,190
'On the night of July 2, 1947,

257
00:14:25,317 --> 00:14:27,836
'conditions were clear over
Roswell, New Mexico.'

258
00:14:27,931 --> 00:14:28,952
Oh, jeez.

259
00:14:29,047 --> 00:14:31,151
Hey, Ted, there's a message
on the machine for you.

260
00:14:31,246 --> 00:14:33,157
- Dr. O'Brien.
- What?

261
00:14:33,318 --> 00:14:36,090
'When suddenly, an array of...'

262
00:14:36,666 --> 00:14:39,948
<i>Ted, hi.
This is Dr. O'Brien. About today.</i>

263
00:14:40,045 --> 00:14:44,412
<i>Listen, I really need to talk to you. Call me.
I'll be at the office all day.</i>

264
00:14:44,507 --> 00:14:46,782
The doctor will see you now.

265
00:14:50,118 --> 00:14:52,382
What should I do?
I should totally go down there, right?

266
00:14:52,477 --> 00:14:55,983
Don't interfere. Some guy is expecting
to marry this woman on Saturday.

267
00:14:56,079 --> 00:14:58,209
Yeah, an 8.5 guy.

268
00:14:58,310 --> 00:15:01,084
Look, if I was marrying the wrong
person and the right person was out there,

269
00:15:01,179 --> 00:15:04,112
and knew it, I'd want that person
to come down to my dermatology office...

270
00:15:04,207 --> 00:15:06,948
and tell me so.
In that scenario, I'm not interfering,

271
00:15:07,044 --> 00:15:10,647
- I'm a happy ending.
- Happy ending?

272
00:15:10,742 --> 00:15:12,878
Look, I have to go down there.
I don't know what's gonna happen...

273
00:15:12,974 --> 00:15:14,727
when I get there, but I gotta give it a shot.

274
00:15:14,822 --> 00:15:18,521
- All right, see you later. Happy hunting.
- Wait, where are you guys going?

275
00:15:18,616 --> 00:15:20,465
Don't you wanna stay
and see the cockamouse?

276
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:24,053
Yeah, we're gonna go
make some crop circles.

277
00:15:27,127 --> 00:15:30,187
- Oh, my God!
- Holy crap buckets, we got it.

278
00:15:30,282 --> 00:15:33,471
- What do we do with it?
- Calm down, I have a plan.

279
00:15:34,107 --> 00:15:35,478
I told my friend Sudeep about it.

280
00:15:35,573 --> 00:15:38,028
He wants to show it
to the Columbia Biology department.

281
00:15:38,124 --> 00:15:40,992
- But it has to be alive.
- Wait, no, no!

282
00:15:41,088 --> 00:15:44,467
They'll do lab experiments on it.
That's so mean.

283
00:15:44,563 --> 00:15:48,217
Shouldn't we just beat it to death
with a bat?

284
00:15:51,830 --> 00:15:53,741
Hello, again.

285
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:59,098
I'm glad you came down.
I would prefer to say this to you in person.

286
00:15:59,194 --> 00:16:02,063
Go ahead, Sarah.
You can tell me anything.

287
00:16:02,158 --> 00:16:04,756
You have a basal cell carcinoma.

288
00:16:05,792 --> 00:16:07,704
Anything else?

289
00:16:08,725 --> 00:16:11,779
Your mole. The biopsy came back.

290
00:16:11,881 --> 00:16:15,324
It's not life-threatening,
but we should excise the rest of it.

291
00:16:15,419 --> 00:16:17,523
Wait, then you're still getting married?

292
00:16:17,619 --> 00:16:21,093
- Of course I'm still getting married.
- But we're a 9.6.

293
00:16:21,189 --> 00:16:23,829
- Excuse me?
- Okay, I...

294
00:16:24,185 --> 00:16:27,277
I went to Love Solutions
and I saw on Ellen Pierce's computer...

295
00:16:27,373 --> 00:16:30,880
that you and I are a 9.6.
Your fiancé's only an 8.5.

296
00:16:30,975 --> 00:16:34,577
- You looked at my file?
- I had to. You're my only match.

297
00:16:34,673 --> 00:16:37,064
Aren't you even a little curious?
The woman who set you up...

298
00:16:37,159 --> 00:16:38,593
with your fiancé
thinks we're a better match.

299
00:16:38,688 --> 00:16:41,368
I am getting married on Saturday.

300
00:16:45,766 --> 00:16:46,691
Ted.

301
00:16:46,786 --> 00:16:49,687
Look, don't you think you're being
a little impulsive marrying a guy...

302
00:16:49,782 --> 00:16:52,365
- you just met a few months ago?
- Don't you think it's a little impulsive...

303
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:55,329
for you to proposition an engaged woman
you don't even know?

304
00:16:55,425 --> 00:16:58,867
See, we're both impulsive.
We're perfect for each other!

305
00:16:58,964 --> 00:17:00,907
- Ted, just calm down.
- Calm down?

306
00:17:01,002 --> 00:17:02,438
You're my only match!

307
00:17:02,533 --> 00:17:05,147
Come on, there was a computer,
and there were eight fish...

308
00:17:05,243 --> 00:17:08,897
- in a sea full of lesbians.
- Okay, Ted, Ted.

309
00:17:09,483 --> 00:17:13,817
Do you honestly believe deep down
that there is no one else out there for you...

310
00:17:13,914 --> 00:17:16,756
just because some computer says so?

311
00:17:18,057 --> 00:17:22,448
I didn't use to, but there was math,
I got confused.

312
00:17:22,933 --> 00:17:27,075
Love isn't a science.
You can't calculate a feeling.

313
00:17:27,428 --> 00:17:32,463
When you fall in love with someone,
an 8.5 equals a perfect 10.

314
00:17:33,782 --> 00:17:35,692
You're right.

315
00:17:35,757 --> 00:17:39,934
If this thing is what you say it is,
it could be huge for my career.

316
00:17:40,029 --> 00:17:44,495
Brace yourself, dude.
This is gonna blow your mind-hole.

317
00:17:47,233 --> 00:17:49,880
You bastard.
I actually got excited about this.

318
00:17:49,975 --> 00:17:51,885
- What?
- It's empty.

319
00:17:54,342 --> 00:17:57,671
Wait, but if it's not here, that means...

320
00:17:58,071 --> 00:17:59,982
Lily!

321
00:18:00,304 --> 00:18:01,897
- Robin!
- What?

322
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:10,024
- Oh, my God! It's real!
- No, is it? Do something!

323
00:18:14,424 --> 00:18:17,293
No! What the hell was that?
You trying to get it drunk?

324
00:18:17,389 --> 00:18:19,652
It was the only thing I could think of!

325
00:18:19,748 --> 00:18:21,658
Lily! Thank God!

326
00:18:24,497 --> 00:18:26,408
Lily, I love you!

327
00:18:26,697 --> 00:18:28,761
Robin, open the window!

328
00:18:31,064 --> 00:18:35,010
Please, for the love of God,
open the window!

329
00:18:37,248 --> 00:18:39,160
It can fly.

330
00:18:39,893 --> 00:18:41,805
Wow.

331
00:18:42,603 --> 00:18:46,907
Be free, mutant beast.
I'll miss this private war of ours.

332
00:18:47,003 --> 00:18:48,692
I grew to admire your tenacious...

333
00:18:48,787 --> 00:18:50,733
Holy mother of God! It's headed this way!

334
00:18:50,828 --> 00:18:52,738
Close the window!

335
00:19:00,683 --> 00:19:02,594
Hi, Ellen.

336
00:19:04,030 --> 00:19:06,385
I think I want my money back.

337
00:19:06,834 --> 00:19:11,169
I'm a failure. I'm all washed up.
I tried everything, Ted.

338
00:19:11,264 --> 00:19:14,930
I widened the search parameters,
I tweaked the program.

339
00:19:15,025 --> 00:19:18,819
Last night, I stood out on the street
for five hours...

340
00:19:18,915 --> 00:19:22,421
showing your photo
to random pedestrians. No takers.

341
00:19:22,518 --> 00:19:26,055
Although this transvestite hooker said
he/she would do you for half price...

342
00:19:26,150 --> 00:19:27,681
because you kind of look
like John Cusack...

343
00:19:27,776 --> 00:19:31,430
<i>and his/her favorite movie was
Say Anything...</i>

344
00:19:31,666 --> 00:19:34,885
Come on, Ellen. I mean, a pint of
ice cream. Isn't that a bit cliché?

345
00:19:34,981 --> 00:19:36,891
It's for the bourbon.

346
00:19:37,785 --> 00:19:40,144
This isn't hopeless.
You're gonna find someone for me.

347
00:19:40,239 --> 00:19:43,642
No, I won't. You're gonna die alone.

348
00:19:43,747 --> 00:19:48,464
I'm not gonna die alone. Look at me.
I'm bright. I'm attractive.

349
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:50,313
You just gotta get back out there
and keep looking.

350
00:19:50,409 --> 00:19:52,225
No. You're never gonna find anybody.

351
00:19:52,322 --> 00:19:55,604
And every year, you're just getting
older and it's getting harder and harder.

352
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:58,507
You're being ridiculous. I'm gonna be
up on that wall one of these days.

353
00:19:58,602 --> 00:20:00,896
- No, you won't!
- Yes, I will!

354
00:20:00,991 --> 00:20:04,889
- How do you know?
- I don't know, but I believe.

355
00:20:04,976 --> 00:20:08,037
Hell, if a cockroach and a mouse
can find love in this crazy city,

356
00:20:08,132 --> 00:20:09,790
then damn it, so can I!

357
00:20:09,885 --> 00:20:11,795
You're losing me.

358
00:20:12,085 --> 00:20:14,571
The point is,
something good's gonna happen to me.

359
00:20:14,667 --> 00:20:20,087
I mean, maybe your computer will help,
maybe it won't, but it'll happen.

360
00:20:20,182 --> 00:20:24,102
- So I should keep looking?
- Of course you should.

361
00:20:24,199 --> 00:20:27,447
And now, you're gonna do it for free.
