00:00:16,709 --> 00:00:18,016
<i>Kids, about eight months...</i>

3
00:00:18,112 --> 00:00:20,088
<i>into Aunt Lily and Uncle Marshall's
engagement,</i>

4
00:00:20,184 --> 00:00:22,949
<i>there occurred
a game-changing emergency.</i>

5
00:00:23,125 --> 00:00:24,751
- Van Smoot is available.
- Oh, my God.

6
00:00:25,651 --> 00:00:27,531
<i>Van Smoot House
was a gorgeous mansion...</i>

7
00:00:27,627 --> 00:00:28,775
<i>right on the Hudson River.</i>

8
00:00:28,870 --> 00:00:31,453
<i>It had everything Marshall and Lily
wanted for their wedding,</i>

9
00:00:31,548 --> 00:00:35,245
<i>but it was never available.
And then, suddenly, it was.</i>

10
00:00:35,341 --> 00:00:37,413
There was a cancellation
two months from now.

11
00:00:37,508 --> 00:00:39,709
You want to have our wedding
in two months?

12
00:00:39,804 --> 00:00:41,207
No. It's impossible.

13
00:00:41,302 --> 00:00:44,011
It's Van Smoot, Lily. It's the dream.

14
00:00:44,107 --> 00:00:47,486
No, there's just not enough time.
There's no...

15
00:00:47,581 --> 00:00:48,793
Mini-vomit.

16
00:00:48,888 --> 00:00:51,438
Okay, look, look, look.
I know that it's sudden, but check it.

17
00:00:51,534 --> 00:00:54,499
If we don't take this, guess who's
on their way with a deposit check?

18
00:00:54,594 --> 00:00:56,505
Todd and Valerie?

19
00:00:58,132 --> 00:00:59,376
<i>When you're planning a wedding,</i>

20
00:00:59,471 --> 00:01:01,065
<i>there's always one couple
with similar taste...</i>

21
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:03,233
<i>that seems to be one step ahead of you.</i>

22
00:01:03,328 --> 00:01:06,089
<i>Todd and Valerie were that couple.</i>

23
00:01:06,452 --> 00:01:11,081
We got to make a decision.
Todd and Valerie are in motion.

24
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:13,431
Van Smoot!

25
00:01:13,816 --> 00:01:15,726
No! Kids, color!

26
00:01:18,915 --> 00:01:22,488
- Baby, pick me.
- Come on, come on, come on.

27
00:01:34,312 --> 00:01:37,116
Hello, Marshall. Lily.

28
00:01:37,978 --> 00:01:40,586
Todd. Valerie.

29
00:01:42,472 --> 00:01:44,382
Stairs.

30
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:50,216
I can't believe it.
We got Van Smoot House.

31
00:01:50,314 --> 00:01:55,592
It is on. It is on! Like the former
Soviet Republic of Azerbaijan.

32
00:01:56,307 --> 00:01:57,550
- What?
- You're a wonder.

33
00:01:57,645 --> 00:01:59,622
Wow. You guys are getting married
in two months.

34
00:01:59,717 --> 00:02:01,024
How are you going to get everything done?

35
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:04,275
Division of labor.
Everyone's got a job to do, so listen up.

36
00:02:04,371 --> 00:02:07,862
Okay, Robin, you and Ted go to the florist.

37
00:02:08,642 --> 00:02:11,670
<i>Robin had been mad at me
since the night I slightly exaggerated...</i>

38
00:02:11,766 --> 00:02:14,188
<i>my not-having-a-girlfriend-ness.</i>

39
00:02:14,284 --> 00:02:17,207
- Was it...
- It was your girlfriend.

40
00:02:17,312 --> 00:02:19,608
You might want to call her back.

41
00:02:20,023 --> 00:02:23,688
Or, actually, Robin,
why don't you go to the florist?

42
00:02:23,784 --> 00:02:28,980
And, Ted, I could use your keen
architectural eye on the invitations.

43
00:02:29,075 --> 00:02:31,836
Wow, that was really awkward, Lil.

44
00:02:33,761 --> 00:02:37,496
And still.
It's still really awkward right now.

45
00:02:38,383 --> 00:02:40,455
Hey, what about me? What's my job?
What do I get to do?

46
00:02:40,551 --> 00:02:42,113
Okay, your job is very simple.

47
00:02:42,208 --> 00:02:46,894
At the wedding, do not sleep with
anyone even remotely related to me.

48
00:02:49,572 --> 00:02:52,414
Lil, you know I can't promise that.

49
00:02:58,019 --> 00:03:01,429
Look how cute she looks. All tuckered out.

50
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:06,430
Hey, babe. Hey, little one. Hey, Lilypad.

51
00:03:06,530 --> 00:03:09,453
Crap! Band! We forgot a band!

52
00:03:09,557 --> 00:03:12,267
It's just gonna be silence
and then people chewing.

53
00:03:12,363 --> 00:03:16,284
Baby, don't worry about it. I called The 88!

54
00:03:16,379 --> 00:03:17,941
- Who?
- The 88.

55
00:03:18,037 --> 00:03:20,714
They're this awesome band.
They played my law review party.

56
00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:23,519
They were found guilty.
On three counts of rocking.

57
00:03:23,615 --> 00:03:25,655
Yeah, I saw them two months ago
at my cousin Bonzo's wedding.

58
00:03:25,751 --> 00:03:26,707
They were great.

59
00:03:26,803 --> 00:03:29,448
John 'Bonzo' Bonham from Led Zeppelin?

60
00:03:29,544 --> 00:03:32,700
Yes, Lily, my cousin, the drummer
from Led Zeppelin who died in 1980,

61
00:03:32,796 --> 00:03:34,988
got married two months ago.

62
00:03:35,473 --> 00:03:38,405
Look, I can't sign off on a band
I've never even seen.

63
00:03:38,501 --> 00:03:40,446
We don't even know
if they can play our song.

64
00:03:40,541 --> 00:03:42,964
They're going to have to
come over here and audition.

65
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:47,012
Baby, The 88 don't audition. They're like
The Wiggles of wedding bands.

66
00:03:47,107 --> 00:03:49,381
Well, then I have to say no.

67
00:03:50,741 --> 00:03:53,260
Baby, they're only holding the date
until Monday.

68
00:03:53,355 --> 00:03:56,352
Well, are they playing
anywhere this weekend?

69
00:03:56,448 --> 00:03:58,640
Let me check their website.

70
00:03:59,316 --> 00:04:00,496
What?

71
00:04:00,592 --> 00:04:02,918
Lily, you're being a wee bit intense
about this band thing.

72
00:04:03,013 --> 00:04:08,176
Intense? I have a wedding to plan
in nine weeks for 200 people.

73
00:04:08,433 --> 00:04:11,333
Even if a dinosaur
should poke his head out of my butt...

74
00:04:11,429 --> 00:04:13,055
and consume this coffee table,

75
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:16,480
- I need you to roll with it, okay?
- Wow.

76
00:04:17,167 --> 00:04:20,334
Guys. I just tasted an amazing caterer.

77
00:04:20,386 --> 00:04:23,734
- We already have a caterer.
- Oh, right. You're getting married.

78
00:04:23,829 --> 00:04:25,859
You see what I did there?

79
00:04:26,887 --> 00:04:30,680
It looks like The 88 are playing
at a high school prom...

80
00:04:30,776 --> 00:04:32,562
in New Jersey tomorrow.

81
00:04:32,657 --> 00:04:34,633
A prom? Can we go to that?

82
00:04:34,728 --> 00:04:39,447
Yeah, we'll just call the high school,
they'll let us stand in the back and watch.

83
00:04:39,542 --> 00:04:41,295
- Yeah. No, they won't.
- Why not?

84
00:04:41,391 --> 00:04:43,176
'Cause it turns out we're not in high school.

85
00:04:43,272 --> 00:04:44,610
No sweat, we'll just sneak in.

86
00:04:44,706 --> 00:04:46,651
We're not sneaking
into a high school prom.

87
00:04:46,746 --> 00:04:48,531
Yes, we are. It's the only way.

88
00:04:48,626 --> 00:04:50,061
You're getting on board with Barney's idea?

89
00:04:50,157 --> 00:04:52,005
Man, you really have snapped.

90
00:04:52,101 --> 00:04:54,396
It's nine weeks till the wedding.
At this point,

91
00:04:54,492 --> 00:04:56,627
I'd say yes to just about anything.

92
00:04:56,723 --> 00:04:58,633
- Well...
- No, Barney.

93
00:05:00,936 --> 00:05:04,124
<i>And so, Aunt Lily
hatched the plan to crash a prom.</i>

94
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:05,750
- I'll go with you.
- Really?

95
00:05:05,846 --> 00:05:07,280
Yeah, I never got to go to my prom.

96
00:05:07,375 --> 00:05:09,702
We always had field hockey nationals
in the spring.

97
00:05:10,881 --> 00:05:12,412
Lesbian.

98
00:05:12,507 --> 00:05:14,739
The cough is supposed to cover
the 'lesbian.'

99
00:05:14,834 --> 00:05:18,213
No, I'm trying to start a thing
where the cough is separate.

100
00:05:18,309 --> 00:05:20,923
Do you think we look young enough
to blend in at a high school?

101
00:05:21,018 --> 00:05:23,760
Please, I'm ageless, Scherbatsky
just needs a good night's sleep,

102
00:05:23,856 --> 00:05:27,107
and you've got 'statutory'
written all over your body.

103
00:05:27,202 --> 00:05:28,541
Hey, why don't we all go?

104
00:05:28,637 --> 00:05:30,645
I don't know.
More people might be harder to sneak in.

105
00:05:30,741 --> 00:05:32,972
We don't want to mess things up for Lily.

106
00:05:33,068 --> 00:05:35,841
Yeah, you're right. Besides, Marshall and I
have been planning...

107
00:05:35,937 --> 00:05:37,530
on having a guys' night out
before the wedding.

108
00:05:37,626 --> 00:05:39,028
Why don't we just make it tomorrow night?

109
00:05:39,124 --> 00:05:42,248
Sounds awesome. We should go out
and just get fricking weird.

110
00:05:42,343 --> 00:05:43,363
- Yeah.
- 'Cause, you know,

111
00:05:43,459 --> 00:05:44,766
you'd be a bad, bad man,

112
00:05:44,861 --> 00:05:46,232
and I be an outlaw.

113
00:05:47,348 --> 00:05:48,304
What?

114
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:52,831
Wow. Hey, Thelma, Louise, y'all don't
drive off no cliffs now, you hear?

115
00:05:52,926 --> 00:05:54,837
Lame!

116
00:05:55,636 --> 00:06:00,345
But seriously, leave me a message,
and we'll meet up later.

117
00:06:02,193 --> 00:06:04,548
All right, what do you think?

118
00:06:04,679 --> 00:06:06,273
Horrible.

119
00:06:06,368 --> 00:06:09,014
You're gonna make such a great dad.

120
00:06:09,109 --> 00:06:12,266
You look so classy and nice.
You're gonna stick out like a sore thumb.

121
00:06:12,361 --> 00:06:14,465
Have you seen how the kids
are dressing these days,

122
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,855
with the Ashlee and the Lindsay
and the Paris?

123
00:06:16,951 --> 00:06:20,935
They all dress like strippers.
It's go ho or go home.

124
00:06:21,031 --> 00:06:23,549
Well, we have to get in.
I have to see this band,

125
00:06:23,645 --> 00:06:25,494
'cause we have to
make a decision by Monday,

126
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:27,279
'cause I'm getting married in 71 days,

127
00:06:27,374 --> 00:06:28,426
and we still don't have...

128
00:06:28,522 --> 00:06:31,391
Sweetie,
just focus on one thing at a time, okay?

129
00:06:31,487 --> 00:06:34,419
Right now, you just have to dress
like a whore and that's it.

130
00:06:34,514 --> 00:06:36,395
- All right.
- That's the spirit.

131
00:06:36,491 --> 00:06:38,588
Now, ladies, slut up.

132
00:06:42,069 --> 00:06:47,999
I never thought this would be a bad thing,
but my wardrobe just isn't slutty enough.

133
00:06:48,094 --> 00:06:51,342
- I didn't know I still had this.
- What?

134
00:06:52,046 --> 00:06:54,889
The dress I wore to my actual prom.

135
00:06:59,442 --> 00:07:04,447
Dude, you are the hottest girl at this prom,
and not like in a corporate, plastic way.

136
00:07:04,542 --> 00:07:07,944
Like, truly, truly hot. Like a hot soul.

137
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:11,639
You look great, too, Scooter.

138
00:07:11,746 --> 00:07:15,644
So, big news. I heard from umpire school.
I'm in!

139
00:07:16,049 --> 00:07:20,701
Oh, disco! I am so happy for you.

140
00:07:21,054 --> 00:07:23,896
You mean happy for us, right, babe?

141
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:27,780
Scooter, you're gonna be
an umpire someday.

142
00:07:27,875 --> 00:07:31,821
No, baby.
We're gonna be an umpire someday.

143
00:07:33,836 --> 00:07:34,760
Nice.

144
00:07:34,856 --> 00:07:37,916
Now, you ladies look good,
but your outfits are missing just one thing.

145
00:07:38,012 --> 00:07:41,040
No, Barney, this is as far as we're going
to go. I'm not showing any more...

146
00:07:41,136 --> 00:07:44,419
Two beautiful flowers
for two beautiful flowers.

147
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:47,825
Sweet. Thank you.

148
00:07:47,925 --> 00:07:49,456
Hmm.

149
00:07:49,551 --> 00:07:50,172
- Robin, are you tearing up?
- No.

150
00:07:50,268 --> 00:07:52,948
- Robin, are you tearing up?
- No.

151
00:07:53,568 --> 00:07:56,341
I've never been to prom before, okay?

152
00:07:56,436 --> 00:07:58,476
- We got to go. See you.
- Bye, have fun.

153
00:07:58,572 --> 00:08:00,482
- Bye.
- See you.

154
00:08:02,079 --> 00:08:04,819
They grow up into skanks so fast,
don't they, Ted?

155
00:08:04,915 --> 00:08:06,860
- So, what, we ready for tonight?
- Yeah.

156
00:08:06,956 --> 00:08:08,167
Just one thing we got to do first.

157
00:08:08,262 --> 00:08:09,219
Shot of Jim Beam?

158
00:08:09,314 --> 00:08:10,366
- Yeah.
- Yes!

159
00:08:10,462 --> 00:08:13,872
And then I promised Lily that we'd stuff
200 wedding invitations.

160
00:08:13,968 --> 00:08:15,403
- What?
- I'm sorry, dude,

161
00:08:15,498 --> 00:08:16,965
but you saw how stressed out she is.

162
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:19,960
Come on! You've been doing
wedding stuff nonstop. Take a break.

163
00:08:20,056 --> 00:08:21,555
Once you're married, if we go out,

164
00:08:21,650 --> 00:08:23,658
and you get so drunk
you throw up, it'll be sad,

165
00:08:23,754 --> 00:08:26,496
but if we do it tonight, it'll be less sad.

166
00:08:27,064 --> 00:08:30,060
Okay, it'll be cool. I'll tell you what.
We'll make a game out of it.

167
00:08:30,156 --> 00:08:33,566
First one to stuff 100 invitations
gets a big prize.

168
00:08:33,662 --> 00:08:35,611
Do I look like I'm four?

169
00:08:35,798 --> 00:08:38,540
All right, what kind of prize
are we talking about?

170
00:08:39,814 --> 00:08:42,332
Wow, a lot more security
than when we were kids.

171
00:08:42,428 --> 00:08:43,894
- Is this gonna work?
- Yeah.

172
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:47,464
Look, when I was 17,
I used to sneak into clubs all the time.

173
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:50,564
It's all about confidence. Follow me.

174
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:54,318
Happy prom, everybody. Going to prom.

175
00:08:56,199 --> 00:08:58,473
- You're adults.
- Okay, bye.

176
00:08:59,354 --> 00:09:03,913
Okay, look, I just need to see the band.
I'm getting married in two months, and...

177
00:09:04,009 --> 00:09:05,602
And you're just finding a band?

178
00:09:05,698 --> 00:09:07,608
Hey, hey.

179
00:09:08,312 --> 00:09:14,321
I'm sorry, ma'am. You either need to be
a student or the date of a student.

180
00:09:14,846 --> 00:09:17,617
Wow.'Ma'am?' Check and mate.

181
00:09:17,715 --> 00:09:19,946
It's cool. Time to activate Plan 'B.'

182
00:09:20,042 --> 00:09:23,070
Scherbatsky, how comfortable are you
with a crossbow?

183
00:09:23,166 --> 00:09:25,077
Scherbatsky?

184
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:29,089
Hey, guys.
You want to take two hot girls to prom?

185
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:31,422
We don't have that kind of money.

186
00:09:31,517 --> 00:09:33,713
- For free.
- Oh, hell yeah.

187
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:36,681
- Great. I'm Robin, this is my friend Lily.
- Hi.

188
00:09:36,776 --> 00:09:38,687
- Shall we?
- Sure.

189
00:09:39,837 --> 00:09:43,057
I knew it would happen. This is the dream.

190
00:09:43,152 --> 00:09:44,778
Hey, wait. How's Barney getting in?

191
00:09:44,874 --> 00:09:47,635
Don't worry about me. I'll get in.

192
00:09:47,806 --> 00:09:50,284
Oh, I'll get in.

193
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:03,923
<i>- We're in!
- Thank you. We're going to take a break.</i>

194
00:10:04,019 --> 00:10:05,293
You're kidding me.

195
00:10:05,389 --> 00:10:09,530
Hey, you ladies want something
to take the edge off?

196
00:10:10,458 --> 00:10:12,975
Yeah, what the hell? It's prom.

197
00:10:16,769 --> 00:10:18,363
That tastes like cough syrup.

198
00:10:18,459 --> 00:10:22,348
Yeah, we couldn't get any alcohol.
Our fake IDs say we're only 20.

199
00:10:22,443 --> 00:10:25,120
We didn't realize it till after we bought them.

200
00:10:25,216 --> 00:10:30,169
Nerds who aren't good at math?
Life's going to be rough, boys.

201
00:10:32,793 --> 00:10:34,322
Hi. Excuse me.

202
00:10:34,418 --> 00:10:37,925
<i>I was wondering if you guys could
play Good Feelingby the Violent Femmes.</i>

203
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:39,709
I know it's probably not in your repertoire,

204
00:10:39,805 --> 00:10:43,088
but I'm getting married and my fiancé
wants to hire you guys as the band,

205
00:10:43,184 --> 00:10:45,192
<i>but I can't sign off on it
until I hear you play Good Feeling...</i>

206
00:10:45,288 --> 00:10:46,499
because that's our song,

207
00:10:46,594 --> 00:10:47,743
and what kind of wedding band
would you be...

208
00:10:47,838 --> 00:10:50,484
if you couldn't play our song, right? Right?

209
00:10:50,579 --> 00:10:54,532
Look, I'm kind of wasted right now,
so I didn't understand any of that.

210
00:10:54,628 --> 00:10:57,464
But if you get us the sheet music,
we'll play your song.

211
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:58,517
Okay.

212
00:10:58,612 --> 00:11:00,840
So, you buzzing, baby?

213
00:11:02,055 --> 00:11:03,965
My phlegm feels looser.

214
00:11:16,048 --> 00:11:21,914
This is pathetic. It's guys' night.
We should be out in a bar getting in fights.

215
00:11:22,009 --> 00:11:24,113
Hey, if I got in a fight,
would you have my back?

216
00:11:24,209 --> 00:11:26,119
You know it.

217
00:11:26,791 --> 00:11:28,740
I'd have your back, too.

218
00:11:29,436 --> 00:11:30,998
That's cool.

219
00:11:32,178 --> 00:11:35,365
What, you don't think you'd need my help?
Hey, you don't know what I can do.

220
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:36,481
I'm like...

221
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:38,648
Like a berserker.

222
00:11:38,744 --> 00:11:41,069
Okay, Ted. Hello?

223
00:11:41,262 --> 00:11:42,633
Hey, it's Robin.

224
00:11:42,729 --> 00:11:45,630
<i>Lily needs you to download
the sheet music for Good Feeling...</i>

225
00:11:45,725 --> 00:11:48,084
and bring it out here, like, now.

226
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:51,996
Hang on. It's Robin.
She wants me to go to prom.

227
00:11:52,865 --> 00:11:55,606
- Can Ted come?
- Wait! Don't ask! That's so lame!

228
00:11:55,702 --> 00:11:58,300
I don't even want to go, anyway.

229
00:11:58,571 --> 00:12:01,184
I don't know.
Things have been so weird between us.

230
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:03,448
What'd she say? What'd she say?

231
00:12:03,543 --> 00:12:05,966
He lied and told me he broke up
with his girlfriend...

232
00:12:06,061 --> 00:12:07,687
to try to hook up with me.

233
00:12:07,783 --> 00:12:12,118
I mean, I know he apologized for it
but it's just... It's not easy to forgive.

234
00:12:12,214 --> 00:12:14,318
Well, look,
if you absolutely must bring Ted,

235
00:12:14,414 --> 00:12:17,474
it's not like I'm going to claw
my own eyes out if he comes.

236
00:12:17,569 --> 00:12:19,480
Okay, bye.

237
00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:21,777
She totally wants you to come.

238
00:12:26,143 --> 00:12:29,067
All right, sheet music's on the way.

239
00:12:30,716 --> 00:12:32,405
You okay?

240
00:12:32,501 --> 00:12:36,358
There's just so much to do
for this wedding. My head is swirling.

241
00:12:36,454 --> 00:12:38,899
It's just all moving too fast.

242
00:12:39,195 --> 00:12:42,765
How is it moving too fast?
We've been together for two years.

243
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:44,168
I just...

244
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:47,706
I just don't want everything
in my life to be decided already.

245
00:12:47,801 --> 00:12:51,085
What's decided?
I go to umpire school, you go to college.

246
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:53,221
We move into my dad's house
in Staten Island.

247
00:12:53,316 --> 00:12:58,676
We have kids, we grow old together.
What's decided? It's wide open!

248
00:12:58,799 --> 00:13:03,701
Scooter, when I go off to college,
that's the end for us.

249
00:13:05,014 --> 00:13:07,394
You're breaking up with me?

250
00:13:07,979 --> 00:13:10,401
There's still so much I want to do.

251
00:13:10,497 --> 00:13:14,151
I want to travel, live overseas as an artist,

252
00:13:14,290 --> 00:13:17,051
maybe have a lesbian relationship.

253
00:13:17,733 --> 00:13:22,100
Plus, I think I was just dating you 'cause
you look a little bit like Kurt Cobain.

254
00:13:22,196 --> 00:13:24,106
I can't believe this.

255
00:13:24,650 --> 00:13:27,041
I can change.
I can look more like Kurt Cobain.

256
00:13:27,137 --> 00:13:30,866
Please, just don't leave me!
I'm nothing without you, baby.

257
00:13:30,962 --> 00:13:34,914
Please don't put that kind
of pressure on me! It's too much!

258
00:13:35,009 --> 00:13:37,933
- It's just one dance. God!
- What?

259
00:13:38,644 --> 00:13:41,290
Well, we did promise them one dance.

260
00:13:41,385 --> 00:13:43,296
Yeah, sure, okay.

261
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:55,952
So, Andrew, what's your big plan?
What's life going to be like after tonight?

262
00:13:56,048 --> 00:13:58,343
Well, you know, I got it all worked out.

263
00:13:58,439 --> 00:14:01,403
Leave this place in my dust,
four awesome years at college,

264
00:14:01,499 --> 00:14:05,355
and then I'll move to Prague or start my
own video game company or something.

265
00:14:05,451 --> 00:14:07,236
- No, you won't.
- I won't?

266
00:14:07,332 --> 00:14:10,615
No, you won't accomplish anything
you set out to.

267
00:14:10,711 --> 00:14:13,038
You'll get a girlfriend
the first day of college...

268
00:14:13,134 --> 00:14:15,620
and you'll give up your independence
and you'll never live abroad...

269
00:14:15,716 --> 00:14:17,884
and you'll wind up old
before your time, wondering,

270
00:14:17,979 --> 00:14:21,633
'Whatever happened
to my hopes and my dreams?'

271
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:24,907
You really think I'll get a girlfriend?

272
00:14:25,565 --> 00:14:29,788
So, what's the deal here?
Am I getting lucky tonight?

273
00:14:30,092 --> 00:14:35,254
Sean, look, you're a nice guy,
but I just don't...

274
00:14:38,061 --> 00:14:41,066
No, you're not getting lucky tonight.

275
00:14:52,847 --> 00:14:55,851
Okay, just be cool. Don't look at me.

276
00:14:56,002 --> 00:14:58,519
- Okay.
- How'd you get in here?

277
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:01,038
What's it to you, giant turtle?

278
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:03,651
It's me. Barney.

279
00:15:04,258 --> 00:15:07,701
- Hey. Where's Lily?
- She's in the bathroom.

280
00:15:07,797 --> 00:15:09,295
- Wait here, I should go talk to the band.
- All right.

281
00:15:09,390 --> 00:15:10,666
How did you guys get in here?

282
00:15:10,761 --> 00:15:13,661
- We just snuck in the back.
- You just... Are you serious?

283
00:15:13,757 --> 00:15:15,829
I've been trying to get in here all night.

284
00:15:15,925 --> 00:15:20,610
I finally paid a janitor 200 bucks
to let me borrow this mascot costume.

285
00:15:20,706 --> 00:15:22,655
- But you got in.
- Yeah.

286
00:15:22,778 --> 00:15:25,133
Slow and steady won the race.

287
00:15:27,655 --> 00:15:30,046
Hey, bro, have you seen my fiancée, Lily?

288
00:15:30,142 --> 00:15:33,743
Your fiancée? Whoa.
Tonight she's with me, bro.

289
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:35,751
Unless you're looking for trouble.

290
00:15:35,847 --> 00:15:38,844
Listen, little buddy, I understand it's prom
and the adrenaline's pumping, but...

291
00:15:38,939 --> 00:15:40,852
No, not tonight.
I've waited too long for this.

292
00:15:40,947 --> 00:15:44,135
I finally got a girl and I'm not going
to let you take her away from me.

293
00:15:44,231 --> 00:15:45,697
Whoah, whoah.

294
00:15:45,793 --> 00:15:48,757
- Look, let's not get carried away.
- Nunchaku!

295
00:15:49,905 --> 00:15:51,815
I'm coming at you!

296
00:15:52,614 --> 00:15:55,611
I can't believe I unloaded like that
on a high school senior.

297
00:15:55,706 --> 00:16:00,660
I can't believe a high school senior
unloaded like that on me.

298
00:16:01,093 --> 00:16:04,408
I'm going to ask you something
and maybe it's crazy...

299
00:16:04,504 --> 00:16:06,352
'cause you guys are the cutest couple ever.

300
00:16:06,448 --> 00:16:09,306
But are you having second thoughts?

301
00:16:12,441 --> 00:16:13,812
Yeah.

302
00:16:13,907 --> 00:16:16,587
But not about Marshall. About me.

303
00:16:17,222 --> 00:16:21,207
I just keep thinking about
the girl I was 10 years ago...

304
00:16:21,302 --> 00:16:24,144
and wondering what happened to her.

305
00:16:24,299 --> 00:16:25,957
I don't want to be tied down.

306
00:16:26,052 --> 00:16:29,144
I want to live in France
and Spain and Italy...

307
00:16:29,239 --> 00:16:32,460
and just soak up life and put it on a canvas,

308
00:16:32,555 --> 00:16:36,252
even if it means being
a waitress in crappy cafés for five years,

309
00:16:36,348 --> 00:16:38,675
I don't care. I'm going to be a painter.

310
00:16:38,771 --> 00:16:45,023
And I can't do any of that with a boyfriend
shackled around my neck, you know?

311
00:16:45,209 --> 00:16:49,919
But, anyway, I'm blabbering.
Way to make new friends, Lily.

312
00:16:50,246 --> 00:16:52,860
I'm sorry. What was your name again?

313
00:16:52,955 --> 00:16:54,866
Marshall.

314
00:16:55,544 --> 00:16:59,178
Nice to meet you, Marshall.
Guess we're hall mates.

315
00:16:59,273 --> 00:17:01,184
Yeah.

316
00:17:03,163 --> 00:17:05,073
It works.

317
00:17:05,139 --> 00:17:09,215
- Violent Femmes. I love this song.
- Me, too.

318
00:17:12,184 --> 00:17:16,163
I didn't have any of the experiences
I set out to.

319
00:17:16,518 --> 00:17:21,681
The travel, the bohemian art life,
my big lesbian experience.

320
00:17:22,129 --> 00:17:24,039
I didn't do any of it.

321
00:17:24,742 --> 00:17:28,377
Lily, you're marrying
your best friend in the world.

322
00:17:28,472 --> 00:17:33,263
I mean, isn't that worth
all the other experiences combined?

323
00:17:33,381 --> 00:17:34,720
Yeah.

324
00:17:34,815 --> 00:17:38,258
And, look, you can still travel.
I mean, you can still paint.

325
00:17:38,354 --> 00:17:41,602
And as far as your lesbian experience...

326
00:17:44,092 --> 00:17:46,002
- Happy?
- Yeah.

327
00:17:46,705 --> 00:17:49,385
- So field hockey, huh?
- Shut up.

328
00:17:51,518 --> 00:17:54,159
Trespassing, assaulting a minor.

329
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:57,543
And this mascot costume you stole
cost $5,000.

330
00:17:57,638 --> 00:17:59,615
We can have you guys arrested,
you know that?

331
00:17:59,710 --> 00:18:01,973
Oh, come on, you're the one who let in
a kid with nunchucks.

332
00:18:02,069 --> 00:18:04,715
You call yourself security guards?
I was just defending my boy here.

333
00:18:04,811 --> 00:18:07,744
- I totally could have taken that kid.
- Yeah, and I totally had your back, so...

334
00:18:07,839 --> 00:18:10,644
- Well, I didn't need it, but thanks.
- Yeah, you did, and you're welcome.

335
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:13,513
No, the kid was totally like
a white belt and I'm gigantic.

336
00:18:13,608 --> 00:18:16,987
Listen, guys, I'm sorry. Please, I just need
to get in there for one more song.

337
00:18:17,083 --> 00:18:18,994
Absolutely not.

338
00:18:19,729 --> 00:18:23,044
You guys will thank me for this later, okay?

339
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:26,922
- Listen, Don, Ray, can't we all...
- Hey!

340
00:18:29,451 --> 00:18:33,267
You know, for a turtle,
he's surprisingly quick.

341
00:18:34,806 --> 00:18:39,141
This one goes out to that redhead girl
and that tall guy.

342
00:19:02,123 --> 00:19:05,278
- So, how was your first prom?
- You tell me.

343
00:19:05,374 --> 00:19:10,186
I hated my dress, my date got wasted
and puked on me, there was a huge fight,

344
00:19:10,282 --> 00:19:12,193
and I kissed a girl.

345
00:19:12,354 --> 00:19:14,267
So, basically, it was a prom.

346
00:19:16,243 --> 00:19:21,034
Okay, I've missed you.
Not in a we're-going-to-make-out way,

347
00:19:21,248 --> 00:19:26,445
not even in an l-forgive-you way.
Just in an I've-missed-you way.

348
00:19:27,464 --> 00:19:29,494
I'll take what I can get.

349
00:19:31,767 --> 00:19:34,668
And that, my friends, is why
you don't get your money's worth...

350
00:19:34,763 --> 00:19:37,687
when you wear jeans to a strip club.

351
00:19:40,086 --> 00:19:43,529
So you got to admit,
The 88 are rocking our song.

352
00:19:43,625 --> 00:19:45,535
Yeah, it's good.

353
00:19:45,856 --> 00:19:47,767
Band. Check.

354
00:19:49,588 --> 00:19:52,360
Two months, baby. Two months.

355
00:19:54,497 --> 00:19:56,408
Two months.

356
00:20:04,028 --> 00:20:05,939
Two months.
