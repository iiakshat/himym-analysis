00:00:12,813 --> 00:00:16,697
Kids, when you're single,
all you're looking for is happily-ever-after,

3
00:00:16,792 --> 00:00:19,148
but only one of your stories
can end that way.

4
00:00:19,243 --> 00:00:23,508
The rest end with someone getting hurt.
This is one of those stories.

5
00:00:23,604 --> 00:00:26,816
- And it starts with a shirt.
- A shirt?

6
00:00:26,914 --> 00:00:28,219
Just listen.

7
00:00:28,314 --> 00:00:29,652
<i>Because none of this
would have happened...</i>

8
00:00:29,747 --> 00:00:32,829
<i>if it hadn't have been for that shirt.</i>

9
00:00:35,318 --> 00:00:37,726
- Nice shirt.
- Right? Right?

10
00:00:37,832 --> 00:00:40,888
Look at those colors.
Green and brown, together at last.

11
00:00:41,411 --> 00:00:44,435
- Hot top, bro. Is it new?
- That's the crazy part.

12
00:00:44,531 --> 00:00:48,000
I've had this shirt for, like, six years.
Until this morning, I wasn't into it at all,

13
00:00:48,096 --> 00:00:50,197
but now it's like my tastes have changed.

14
00:00:50,293 --> 00:00:52,553
- Booger.
- Yes, hello, Barney.

15
00:00:52,648 --> 00:00:56,372
Barney's offered me 50 bucks to say
some stupid word on a live news report.

16
00:00:56,468 --> 00:00:58,900
Not some stupid word.'Booger.'

17
00:00:59,714 --> 00:01:02,929
- But I'm not doing it. I am a journalist.
- What? Journalist?

18
00:01:03,024 --> 00:01:05,603
You do the little fluff pieces
at the end of the news.

19
00:01:05,698 --> 00:01:09,200
Old people, babies, monkeys.
That's not journalism.

20
00:01:09,296 --> 00:01:11,619
That's just things in a diaper.

21
00:01:11,714 --> 00:01:15,343
For your information,
my boss is about to bump me up...

22
00:01:15,438 --> 00:01:19,378
- to the City Hall beat.
- City Hall. Miss Thing!

23
00:01:19,545 --> 00:01:22,919
So I'm not gonna jeopardize my promotion
by saying 'booger' for 50 bucks.

24
00:01:23,015 --> 00:01:24,479
Of course not.

25
00:01:24,574 --> 00:01:28,386
'Cause now you're saying 'nipple'
and it's $100.

26
00:01:28,490 --> 00:01:30,922
Step into my web.

27
00:01:33,327 --> 00:01:34,410
Whose bourbon is this?

28
00:01:34,505 --> 00:01:37,689
I don't know.
It was here when we sat down.

29
00:01:37,784 --> 00:01:40,394
The point is, I seem to like bourbon now.

30
00:01:40,490 --> 00:01:42,081
I could have sworn I hated bourbon.

31
00:01:42,176 --> 00:01:44,086
First the shirt, now bourbon.

32
00:01:44,181 --> 00:01:46,792
I spent 27 years making up my mind
about things, right?

33
00:01:46,888 --> 00:01:48,479
The movie I saw once and hated,

34
00:01:48,574 --> 00:01:51,280
the city I'll never go back to
'cause it was raining the day I visited.

35
00:01:51,375 --> 00:01:54,049
Maybe it's time to start forming
some second impressions.

36
00:01:54,145 --> 00:01:56,532
<i>You're finally gonna watch Goonies again.</i>

37
00:01:56,628 --> 00:01:58,536
'Sloth love Chunk.'

38
00:01:59,715 --> 00:02:01,647
<i>Not Goonies. Girls.</i>

39
00:02:01,753 --> 00:02:03,217
What if there's someone from my past...

40
00:02:03,312 --> 00:02:05,286
who I thought was wrong for me
at the time,

41
00:02:05,381 --> 00:02:09,297
when, in fact, she, like this shirt,
is actually a perfect fit?

42
00:02:09,392 --> 00:02:12,988
Hold up. There are only two reasons
to ever date a girl you've already dated.

43
00:02:13,084 --> 00:02:14,992
Breast implants.

44
00:02:15,631 --> 00:02:17,127
This isn't a bad idea.

45
00:02:17,222 --> 00:02:19,898
Let's think. Ted's greatest hits.

46
00:02:20,437 --> 00:02:23,584
- What about that girl, Steph?
- Steph.

47
00:02:24,641 --> 00:02:26,392
Okay, this is difficult to say.

48
00:02:26,487 --> 00:02:29,256
Back when I lived in LA,
I was pretty broke,

49
00:02:29,352 --> 00:02:32,716
so I spent a month making adult films.

50
00:02:34,126 --> 00:02:37,306
Wow! Okay. How many did you make?

51
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:39,408
175.

52
00:02:41,278 --> 00:02:45,003
Say what you will about the porn industry,
they're hard workers.

53
00:02:45,098 --> 00:02:47,670
What about that chick, Jackie?

54
00:02:48,313 --> 00:02:51,656
And my bathing suit
had fallen completely off.

55
00:02:51,751 --> 00:02:54,393
I know the feeling. Once, when I was 16,

56
00:02:54,488 --> 00:02:57,732
I was driving and I hit this hitchhiker.

57
00:02:57,767 --> 00:03:01,821
Don't know what happened to him.
Just kept driving.

58
00:03:03,146 --> 00:03:04,547
No.

59
00:03:04,642 --> 00:03:06,574
What about Natalie?

60
00:03:07,316 --> 00:03:09,476
- Natalie!
- Natalie!

61
00:03:09,576 --> 00:03:11,040
Who's Natalie?

62
00:03:11,136 --> 00:03:14,623
<i>Natalie. I had so many
fond memories of her.</i>

63
00:03:15,179 --> 00:03:17,375
<i>The tea candles on her dresser.</i>

64
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:19,571
<i>The sock monkey collection on her bed.</i>

65
00:03:19,666 --> 00:03:23,104
<i>That one Belle and Sebastian song
she always listened to.</i>

66
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,108
<i>Her smile.</i>

67
00:03:25,619 --> 00:03:27,974
Man, I haven't seen her in,
like, three years.

68
00:03:28,070 --> 00:03:29,184
Well, why did you guys break up?

69
00:03:29,279 --> 00:03:31,030
I just wasn't looking
for a big commitment at the time.

70
00:03:31,125 --> 00:03:33,290
Course, now a big commitment
doesn't seem so bad.

71
00:03:33,385 --> 00:03:35,518
Maybe I should call her.
What do you guys think?

72
00:03:35,614 --> 00:03:38,023
You dumped a porn star?

73
00:03:39,307 --> 00:03:41,089
Friendship over.

74
00:03:41,185 --> 00:03:43,312
Friendship over!

75
00:03:46,023 --> 00:03:48,920
Come in. All right, get back to me then.

76
00:03:49,016 --> 00:03:51,530
- You wanted to see me, Mr. Adams?
- Yes, I did.

77
00:03:51,626 --> 00:03:55,286
I need you to cover a story.
It's down at City Hall.

78
00:03:55,382 --> 00:03:58,268
City Hall? Oh, my God.

79
00:03:59,901 --> 00:04:02,352
So next time you're passing City Hall,

80
00:04:02,448 --> 00:04:05,567
make sure and stop by
New York's oldest hot dog cart.

81
00:04:05,662 --> 00:04:08,496
Today, a delicious hot dog
will cost you $2.50,

82
00:04:08,591 --> 00:04:11,901
but back when the stand
first opened in 1955,

83
00:04:11,997 --> 00:04:14,194
you could get one for only a nipple.

84

Reporting live, Robin Scherbatsky,
Metro News 1.

85
00:04:18,204 --> 00:04:21,038
I said 'nipple' on the news.
That was so unprofessional.

86
00:04:21,133 --> 00:04:23,010
I said 'nipple' on the news.

87
00:04:23,106 --> 00:04:25,812
At least it's better than 'booger.'

88
00:04:25,908 --> 00:04:27,816
Booger.

89
00:04:29,122 --> 00:04:31,030
There she is.

90
00:04:31,095 --> 00:04:36,125
Hey, is it cold in here?
'Cause I can kind of see Robin's nickels.

91
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:38,289
Now, for your next challenge.

92
00:04:38,385 --> 00:04:41,473
There is not going to be another challenge.
I don't care how much you offer me.

93
00:04:41,568 --> 00:04:43,857
Oh, search your soul, Robin.

94
00:04:43,987 --> 00:04:45,769
You and I both know
this wasn't about the money.

95
00:04:45,865 --> 00:04:48,348
Sure, Metro News 1 pays you jack.

96
00:04:48,443 --> 00:04:53,218
And, hey, a little green salad on the side
is good for you, me, and Mr. McGee.

97
00:04:53,313 --> 00:04:55,287
Seriously, who talks like that?

98
00:04:55,382 --> 00:04:58,406
What baby really likes
is the thrill of pulling one over...

99
00:04:58,502 --> 00:05:01,240
on those bean counters
who under-appreciate you...

100
00:05:01,335 --> 00:05:03,340
and still haven't promoted you.

101
00:05:03,436 --> 00:05:07,415
And, so, for two more hundy-sticks,
baby's gonna look in the camera...

102
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:09,418
and say this.

103
00:05:12,157 --> 00:05:14,065
I'm just assuming.

104
00:05:14,162 --> 00:05:16,189
I gotta get back to work.

105
00:05:16,869 --> 00:05:18,174
- See you.
- Bye.

106
00:05:18,269 --> 00:05:20,540
Baby's gonna think about it.

107
00:05:22,852 --> 00:05:25,368
Found it. I found Natalie's number.

108
00:05:25,463 --> 00:05:28,964
Hey, Ted, nice shirt.
Is it yesterday already?

109
00:05:29,059 --> 00:05:30,142
Thank you.

110
00:05:30,238 --> 00:05:34,980
I am calling her. This is crazy.
I haven't talked to her in, like, three years.

111
00:05:35,075 --> 00:05:36,635
I wonder if she even remembers me.

112
00:05:39,437 --> 00:05:41,345
- Hello?
- Natalie.

113
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:44,192
- It's Ted Mosby.
- Go to hell!

114
00:05:47,967 --> 00:05:49,875
She remembers me.

115
00:05:54,379 --> 00:05:57,243
- Why would Natalie hang up on you?
- I don't know.

116
00:05:57,339 --> 00:05:59,695
- Did you sleep with her sister?
- No.

117
00:05:59,790 --> 00:06:01,700
- Did you sleep with her mom?
- No.

118
00:06:01,796 --> 00:06:04,553
I'm losing interest in your story.

119
00:06:04,723 --> 00:06:08,066
Well, you must have done something.
Why did you guys break up?

120
00:06:08,161 --> 00:06:10,837
He wasn't ready for a commitment.

121
00:06:12,172 --> 00:06:15,578
And her birthday
might have been coming up.

122
00:06:15,674 --> 00:06:17,679
Okay, so I didn't want to get
a boyfriend-level gift...

123
00:06:17,775 --> 00:06:19,525
for a girl I was just about to break up with.

124
00:06:19,621 --> 00:06:21,594
So you dumped her
right before her birthday?

125
00:06:21,690 --> 00:06:25,501
No! I didn't dump her
right before her birthday.

126
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:31,013
Natalie! Hey, happy birthday!

127
00:06:32,353 --> 00:06:33,403
Listen...

128
00:06:33,499 --> 00:06:36,459
Never break up with a girl on her birthday!

129
00:06:36,554 --> 00:06:40,183
Lily, please! The shirt!
I know! It was a mistake.

130
00:06:40,279 --> 00:06:43,239
- Well, did she cry her eyes out?
- I don't know.

131
00:06:43,334 --> 00:06:45,242
How do you not...

132
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:47,727
You didn't.

133
00:06:47,823 --> 00:06:50,330
Natalie! Hey, happy birthday!

134
00:06:51,833 --> 00:06:53,741
Listen,

135
00:06:55,048 --> 00:06:56,576
you're awesome.

136
00:06:56,672 --> 00:06:59,309
You really are awesome.

137
00:06:59,823 --> 00:07:01,765
I'm just, like, super busy right now,

138
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:05,453
so maybe we should just call it a day.

139
00:07:07,437 --> 00:07:09,188
But you're awesome.

140
00:07:09,284 --> 00:07:11,606
- On her answering machine!
- Okay.

141
00:07:11,702 --> 00:07:13,963
- And on her birthday!
- Lily, come on.

142
00:07:14,058 --> 00:07:16,859
Who breaks up with somebody
on their answering machine...

143
00:07:16,954 --> 00:07:20,279
- on their birthday?
- Yeah, dude, e-mail.

144
00:07:20,329 --> 00:07:23,639
Not exactly the point
I was trying to make, Marshall.

145
00:07:23,734 --> 00:07:25,930
That is a terrible way
to break up with someone.

146
00:07:26,026 --> 00:07:27,713
Okay, in my client's defense,

147
00:07:27,809 --> 00:07:30,578
is there an un-terrible way to break up
with somebody? No.

148
00:07:30,673 --> 00:07:33,252
Personally, I'd rather hear the bad news
on an answering machine...

149
00:07:33,347 --> 00:07:36,817
than face the humiliation in person.
It's the least painful way you can do it.

150
00:07:36,912 --> 00:07:38,949
- Who are you calling?
- Hi, Marshall, it's Lily.

151
00:07:39,045 --> 00:07:41,082
We're not gonna have sex
for at least a month,

152
00:07:41,178 --> 00:07:43,935
but you're awesome. Okay, bye-bye.

153
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:47,193
No, that was a big mistake, Ted.
You should have done it in person.

154
00:07:47,289 --> 00:07:48,308
Thank you.

155
00:07:48,403 --> 00:07:52,214
Desperate, please-don't-leave-me sex
is amazing.

156
00:07:52,318 --> 00:07:56,106
Okay, it was childish and stupid.
I just... I didn't want to see her cry.

157
00:07:56,202 --> 00:07:58,524
Well, guess what? She cried.

158
00:07:58,780 --> 00:08:01,200
You just didn't have the sack
to face those tears.

159
00:08:01,295 --> 00:08:02,791
That was me then, okay?

160
00:08:02,886 --> 00:08:05,942
This is the new, old-shirt-wearing,
sack-having Ted.

161
00:08:06,037 --> 00:08:07,756
- I'm gonna make this right.
- You know what else?

162
00:08:07,852 --> 00:08:10,812
'My younger sister just got married
and I'm about to turn 30' sex.

163
00:08:10,907 --> 00:08:12,815
Fantastic!

164
00:08:14,091 --> 00:08:17,465
An occasion that was supposed
to be joyous suddenly turned tragic...

165
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:21,061
when Ethel and Sadie Margolis,
New York's oldest twins,

166
00:08:21,157 --> 00:08:25,804
suddenly passed away on this,
the eve of their 100th birthday.

167
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:28,060
I'm a dirty, dirty girl.

170
00:08:40,797 --> 00:08:45,317
Before you say anything, I just wanna say
I really like working here at Metro News 1.

171
00:08:45,412 --> 00:08:48,527
That's great. So my dog keeps going...

172
00:08:52,415 --> 00:08:53,338
What?

173
00:08:53,433 --> 00:08:56,107
What? Well, you have dogs, right?
What do you think that means?

174
00:08:56,203 --> 00:08:57,412
Take him to the vet.

175
00:08:58,749 --> 00:09:01,157
Genius. That's one I owe you.

176
00:09:01,932 --> 00:09:03,840
- Was that all?
- Yeah.

177
00:09:07,268 --> 00:09:10,070
- And nothing about the twins story?
- Oh, yeah. Great job on that one.

178
00:09:10,165 --> 00:09:13,976
New York loves you.
You're a superstar. Bye-bye.

179
00:09:14,335 --> 00:09:15,448
<i>That's when Robin realized...</i>

180
00:09:15,543 --> 00:09:19,355
<i>no one, not even her boss,
watched Metro News 1.</i>

181
00:09:29,645 --> 00:09:31,553
Hi.

182
00:09:32,955 --> 00:09:35,852
Natalie, come on.
I just wanna say I'm sorry.

183
00:09:35,948 --> 00:09:38,080
I only came down here
'cause you wouldn't take my call.

184
00:09:38,175 --> 00:09:42,230
Hey, here's an idea.
Why don't you leave a message?

185
00:09:43,428 --> 00:09:45,392
Good one. Okay, fine.

186
00:09:45,497 --> 00:09:48,170
I'm just gonna leave this sock monkey here.

187
00:09:48,266 --> 00:09:50,173
Goodbye.

188
00:09:55,109 --> 00:09:58,293
Okay, okay. Look, look, look,
I know you're mad, but...

189
00:09:58,388 --> 00:10:00,807
happy birthday, three years ago.

190
00:10:00,903 --> 00:10:03,449
Oh, yeah? Up yours, three years ago.

191
00:10:03,544 --> 00:10:06,251
Look, look, I was an idiot,
leaving that message.

192
00:10:06,346 --> 00:10:10,102
- I realize how much that sucked.
- No, you don't.

193
00:10:10,197 --> 00:10:13,441
<i>Maybe we should just call it a day.</i>

194
00:10:13,858 --> 00:10:15,766
<i>But you're awesome.</i>

195
00:10:17,263 --> 00:10:19,171
<i>Okay, bye.</i>

196
00:10:21,402 --> 00:10:23,310
Surprise.

197
00:10:24,956 --> 00:10:28,585
There was a surprise party that night?
How come nobody told me?

198
00:10:28,681 --> 00:10:32,023
People think I can't keep a secret,
but I totally can.

199
00:10:32,119 --> 00:10:33,583
Sorry. Not the issue.

200
00:10:33,678 --> 00:10:37,753
Look, Natalie, I was just a stupid kid
back then, terrified of commitment.

201
00:10:37,848 --> 00:10:41,222
And I suppose you're suddenly ready
to get married and settle down?

202
00:10:41,318 --> 00:10:44,967
Well, yeah, actually.
I'm a different guy now.

203
00:10:46,156 --> 00:10:47,588
Give me another chance.

204
00:10:47,684 --> 00:10:50,358
You must think I have
absolutely no self-respect.

205
00:10:50,453 --> 00:10:52,886
Come on. Just a cup of coffee.

206
00:10:54,846 --> 00:10:58,008
Please, Natalie, give the guy a chance.

207
00:10:58,570 --> 00:11:00,860
Self-respect is overrated.

208
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,468
Wow!

209
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:10,061
Maybe it was the caffeine,

210
00:11:10,156 --> 00:11:12,352
but you really brought your game up
to a whole new level.

211
00:11:12,448 --> 00:11:15,981
<i>Thanks.
I did just start subscribing to Esquire.</i>

212
00:11:16,077 --> 00:11:17,796
They have some helpful columns.

213
00:11:17,891 --> 00:11:21,549
The following is from the October issue.

214
00:11:22,793 --> 00:11:25,116
<i>So Natalie and I
started dating again.</i>

215
00:11:25,212 --> 00:11:27,313
<i>And, just like that, it all came back.</i>

216
00:11:27,409 --> 00:11:28,873
<i>The tea candles.</i>

217
00:11:28,969 --> 00:11:30,305
<i>The sock monkeys.</i>

218
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:32,788
<i>Belle and Sebastian. All of it.</i>

219
00:11:32,884 --> 00:11:36,098
<i>It seemed like happily-ever-after
wasn't far off.</i>

220
00:11:36,194 --> 00:11:38,932
Well, I better run.
I have my Krav Maga class in half an hour.

221
00:11:39,027 --> 00:11:42,178
Krav Maga.
How cool is it that she does Krav Maga?

222
00:11:42,274 --> 00:11:44,181
Thanks, honey.

223
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:45,839
- Bye, guys.
- Bye.

224
00:11:45,934 --> 00:11:47,842
- Bye.
- Take it easy.

225
00:11:48,162 --> 00:11:49,563
Dude, what's Krav Maga?

226
00:11:49,658 --> 00:11:52,415
I have no idea. Some kind of yoga?

227
00:11:52,937 --> 00:11:54,656
You know, that Natalie, she's good times.

228
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:56,533
Yeah, she's, like, the best girl
you've dated in years.

229
00:11:56,629 --> 00:11:59,081
- Yeah, Ted, hold on to that one.
- Yeah.

230
00:11:59,176 --> 00:12:01,446
I have to break up with her.

231
00:12:03,829 --> 00:12:06,057
I don't get it, man. Natalie's awesome.

232
00:12:06,153 --> 00:12:10,354
I know. She's terrific,
but I have to break up with her.

233
00:12:10,449 --> 00:12:13,537
Why couldn't you leave
that poor girl alone?

234
00:12:13,633 --> 00:12:15,288
I know. I hate this.

235
00:12:15,383 --> 00:12:17,930
These past three weeks have been great.
I should be in love with her,

236
00:12:18,026 --> 00:12:20,062
but I'm not feeling that thing.

237
00:12:20,158 --> 00:12:21,877
It's ineffable.

238
00:12:21,972 --> 00:12:24,034
Ineffable. Good word.

239
00:12:24,869 --> 00:12:26,238
So when are you gonna do it?

240
00:12:26,333 --> 00:12:28,848
She's probably on the subway by now.
You could call her voicemail.

241
00:12:28,943 --> 00:12:31,580
Beep. Dumped. Click. Done.

242
00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:35,691
I have to do this face-to-face. I just...
I don't know what I'm gonna say.

243
00:12:35,787 --> 00:12:38,779
- 'I'm not ready for a commitment.'
- Oh, that's such a cliché.

244
00:12:38,875 --> 00:12:41,102
It's not a cliché. It's a classic.

245
00:12:41,198 --> 00:12:43,745
<i>It's the Stairway to Heaven
of break-up lines.</i>

246
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:46,673
- Well, I think Natalie deserves better.
- Better.

247
00:12:46,769 --> 00:12:49,951
There's no 'better' in breaking up.
There's only less awful.

248
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:53,230
A cliché is a cliché for a reason.
It's comforting.

249
00:12:53,326 --> 00:12:56,668
It doesn't matter. I already told her
I am ready for a commitment so...

250
00:12:56,764 --> 00:12:59,405
Oh, my God, there's no way out.
I'm gonna have to marry her.

251
00:12:59,501 --> 00:13:02,302
No, no. We're gonna get you
out of this. Okay.

252
00:13:02,398 --> 00:13:05,236
How about, 'lt's not you. It's me'?

253
00:13:06,623 --> 00:13:07,737
Six words.

254
00:13:07,832 --> 00:13:11,493
'You look fat in those jeans.'
You're free to go.

255
00:13:11,588 --> 00:13:15,318
Ted, have you considered
telling her the truth?

256
00:13:16,649 --> 00:13:19,418
Seriously, honey, men are working here.

257
00:13:19,514 --> 00:13:22,633
Ted, what is the truth?
Why do you wanna break up with her?

258
00:13:22,729 --> 00:13:25,080
The truth? She's not the one.

259
00:13:25,243 --> 00:13:28,458
- So tell her that.
- Oh, you can't tell her that. That's horrible.

260
00:13:28,554 --> 00:13:31,228
Why? What is so horrible about that?

261
00:13:31,323 --> 00:13:34,761
Yeah, what is so horrible about that?
She's not the one.

262
00:13:34,857 --> 00:13:36,830
Why is that such a heart-breaking thing
to hear?

263
00:13:36,926 --> 00:13:39,409
The chances of one person
being another person's 'the one'

264
00:13:39,504 --> 00:13:41,000
are, like, six billion-to-one.

265
00:13:41,095 --> 00:13:43,419
Yeah, you have better chances
of winning the lottery.

266
00:13:43,515 --> 00:13:46,411
Exactly. You wouldn't take it personally
if you lost the lottery.

267
00:13:46,506 --> 00:13:49,754
All right, man, tell her the truth.
She's gonna cry.

268
00:13:49,849 --> 00:13:53,032
Yeah, and he's gonna sit there,
and he's gonna take it like a man.

269
00:13:53,127 --> 00:13:56,088
- I have to do the mature thing.
- Wanna talk mature?

270
00:13:56,183 --> 00:14:00,608
I just wrapped up a live newscast
by honking my own boobs.

271
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:02,974
And great TV was had by all.

272
00:14:04,586 --> 00:14:06,210
All right, Scherbatsky, new challenge.

273
00:14:06,305 --> 00:14:09,265
And this one's big,
but so is the cash reward.

274
00:14:09,361 --> 00:14:12,312
For $1,000... You heard me.

275
00:14:12,417 --> 00:14:17,769
All you have to do is get up there
on the news and do one of these.

276
00:14:23,462 --> 00:14:25,753
- What the hell is that?
- The Ickey Shuffle.

277
00:14:25,849 --> 00:14:28,332
Then, as you do it, you say this,

278
00:14:28,427 --> 00:14:32,406
'Elbert 'lckey' Woods,
the Bengals were fools to cut you in '91.

279
00:14:32,502 --> 00:14:34,635
'Your 1,525 rushing yards...

280
00:14:34,730 --> 00:14:36,895
'and your 27 touchdowns
will not be forgotten.

281
00:14:36,990 --> 00:14:41,855
'So, Coach Dave Shula, screw you
and your crappy steakhouse.'

282
00:14:42,815 --> 00:14:44,923
Just write it down for me.

283
00:14:45,266 --> 00:14:49,976
What do I care? It's not like
anyone's watching anyway, right?

284
00:14:50,072 --> 00:14:52,296
And she's gonna cry.

285
00:14:54,019 --> 00:14:56,211
Sloth love Chunk.

286
00:14:57,202 --> 00:14:59,110
Thanks, Lil.

287
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:02,073
<i>So the next night,
I took Natalie out to dinner...</i>

288
00:15:02,168 --> 00:15:04,076
<i>to do the mature thing.</i>

289
00:15:04,428 --> 00:15:06,433
Look, Natalie, there's something
I have to say.

290
00:15:06,529 --> 00:15:08,534
Oh, wait, wait.
There's something I have to say first.

291
00:15:08,629 --> 00:15:13,022
Today at work I had not one, not two,
but three birthday cakes.

292
00:15:13,118 --> 00:15:16,173
So, tonight, can we just skip the cake?

293
00:15:16,269 --> 00:15:18,083
- Today is your birthday?
- Yeah.

294
00:15:18,179 --> 00:15:19,993
No, it's okay.
I wasn't telling anyone about it.

295
00:15:20,088 --> 00:15:21,996
Today is your birthday!

296
00:15:25,606 --> 00:15:29,174
- I didn't get you anything.
- Oh, it's okay.

297
00:15:29,394 --> 00:15:33,246
You know, you've already given me
the best present of all.

298
00:15:33,341 --> 00:15:35,249
I can trust again.

299
00:15:37,925 --> 00:15:39,833
You're welcome.

300
00:15:44,418 --> 00:15:46,326
Oh, so much more wine.

301
00:15:53,044 --> 00:15:55,941
Henry, as New York's oldest
hansom-cab driver,

302
00:15:56,037 --> 00:15:57,437
you've seen quite a lot.

303
00:15:57,533 --> 00:16:01,798
<i>In your past 60 years on the job,
what is your most exciting memory?</i>

304
00:16:01,893 --> 00:16:03,294
<i>Well...</i>

305
00:16:03,389 --> 00:16:05,904
- This is it.
- Oh, boy, here we go.

306
00:16:05,999 --> 00:16:08,578
Everyone, everyone, if I may
direct your attention to the television.

307
00:16:08,673 --> 00:16:10,902
You are about to see something amazing.

308
00:16:10,997 --> 00:16:13,439
<i>And then in '72,</i>

309
00:16:13,957 --> 00:16:18,634
<i>Mickey Mantle rode in my cab
for the fourth time.</i>

310
00:16:18,827 --> 00:16:20,865
Come on, baby, bring it home.

311
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:23,629
<i>But the most exciting moment,</i>

312
00:16:24,047 --> 00:16:27,453
<i>that would have to be this one, right now.</i>

313
00:16:28,122 --> 00:16:31,876
<i>- What?
- Look at me. I'm on TV.</i>

314
00:16:32,515 --> 00:16:35,677
<i>I never thought I'd have my story told.</i>

315
00:16:36,398 --> 00:16:39,155
<i>Thank you, Miss Robin Scherbatsky.</i>

316
00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:40,473
<i>Thank you.</i>

317
00:16:40,568 --> 00:16:44,515
<i>And, right then, Aunt Robin
realized how important her job truly was.</i>

318
00:16:44,610 --> 00:16:47,854
<i>It's an honor to tell your story, Henry.</i>

319
00:16:48,270 --> 00:16:51,772
<i>You know, Metro News 1
may not be number one in viewership,</i>

320
00:16:51,868 --> 00:16:53,905
<i>but this reporter takes pride in...</i>

321
00:16:55,242 --> 00:16:58,648
<i>Oh, my God,
I'm covered in horse crap!</i>

322
00:16:58,743 --> 00:17:00,675
<i>And it's in my hair!</i>

323
00:17:00,812 --> 00:17:03,164
<i>- You planned that?
- My knee!</i>

324
00:17:03,168 --> 00:17:06,979
No, Marshall.
That was beyond my wildest dreams.

325
00:17:08,833 --> 00:17:10,776
So if you ever come to Alabama,

326
00:17:10,871 --> 00:17:13,512
my mom throws these huge crawfish boils,

327
00:17:13,608 --> 00:17:15,868
and she's just dying
to meet you, by the way.

328
00:17:15,963 --> 00:17:17,587
Look, Natalie,
there's something I have to say,

329
00:17:17,682 --> 00:17:20,439
and there's no good way to say it.

330
00:17:20,611 --> 00:17:22,519
I wanna break up.

331
00:17:23,030 --> 00:17:25,481
I don't think you're the one for me.

332
00:17:25,576 --> 00:17:29,301
I don't wanna waste your time,
because I really like you.

333
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:32,626
I wanna do right by you,
and I think the best way for me to do that...

334
00:17:32,722 --> 00:17:35,673
is just to be honest. I'm sorry.

335
00:17:39,056 --> 00:17:40,964
Just let it out.

336
00:17:41,635 --> 00:17:43,542
They're only tears.

337
00:17:47,905 --> 00:17:49,902
I'm not the one for you!

338
00:17:50,388 --> 00:17:52,680
I'm sorry. I just... I thought
the mature thing to do would be...

339
00:17:52,775 --> 00:17:55,067
- It's my birthday.
- Yes, I know. I didn't realize that it was...

340
00:17:55,163 --> 00:17:58,505
It's my birthday, and you're telling me
I'm not the one for you?

341
00:17:58,601 --> 00:18:01,306
It's really not such a big deal.
I mean, it's the odds.

342
00:18:01,402 --> 00:18:03,438
It's like you lost the lottery.

343
00:18:03,534 --> 00:18:05,285
Oh, so dating you is like
winning the lottery?

344
00:18:05,381 --> 00:18:09,614
- No, no, no. I didn't mean that.
- Okay, so what's the problem?

345
00:18:09,710 --> 00:18:11,778
- I can't explain it.
- Try.

346
00:18:11,873 --> 00:18:15,563
- It's ineffable.
- I'm not F-able?

347
00:18:16,171 --> 00:18:19,864
No, no, no, no, ineffable.
'lneffable' means it can't be explained.

348
00:18:19,959 --> 00:18:22,219
- Oh, so I'm stupid?
- Oh, God, what's going on?

349
00:18:22,315 --> 00:18:25,370
Okay, what's going on is
you broke my heart...

350
00:18:25,466 --> 00:18:28,426
over my answering machine,
on my birthday,

351
00:18:28,521 --> 00:18:31,036
waited three years for me to get over you,

352
00:18:31,131 --> 00:18:33,233
tracked me down,
begged me to go out with you again,

353
00:18:33,328 --> 00:18:36,384
only so you could dump me
three weeks later,

354
00:18:36,479 --> 00:18:38,476
again on my birthday!

355
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:41,222
No, it's not like that. I'm just...

356
00:18:41,318 --> 00:18:43,164
- It's...
- What?

357
00:18:43,259 --> 00:18:46,259
I'm just, like, super busy right now.

358
00:18:46,824 --> 00:18:48,224
<i>Remember when Natalie said...</i>

359
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,962
I have my Krav Maga class in half an hour.

360
00:18:51,058 --> 00:18:53,763
<i>Turns out Krav Maga is not a kind of yoga.</i>

361
00:18:53,859 --> 00:18:57,711
<i>It's a form of guerrilla street-fighting
developed by the Israeli army.</i>

362
00:19:01,784 --> 00:19:01,864
This is compliments
of those two gentlemen at the bar.

363
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:05,477
This is compliments
of those two gentlemen at the bar.

364
00:19:05,572 --> 00:19:09,349
- 'My knee!'
- 'lt's in my hair!'

365
00:19:11,621 --> 00:19:15,270
But isn't it nice to know
people are watching?

366
00:19:17,509 --> 00:19:21,969
- Oh, my God! Are you all right?
- What happened to you?

367
00:19:22,092 --> 00:19:23,270
Told the truth.

368
00:19:23,366 --> 00:19:26,421
Turns out the truth has
a mean roundhouse kick.

369
00:19:26,985 --> 00:19:28,099
Oh, man.

370
00:19:28,194 --> 00:19:30,773
Oh, well, you did the right thing.
I'm proud of you.

371
00:19:30,868 --> 00:19:32,683
I'm bleeding internally.

372
00:19:32,778 --> 00:19:34,721
Hey, Ted, you know what always
picks me up when I'm down?

373
00:19:34,816 --> 00:19:37,234
Other people's misfortune.
You missed something so amazing.

374
00:19:37,330 --> 00:19:40,227
Please, can we just have one person
in this whole bar who didn't see it?

375
00:19:40,322 --> 00:19:42,073
Fine.

376
00:19:42,168 --> 00:19:43,823
Are you okay?

377
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:46,497
I really thought I was doing it
the good way this time.

378
00:19:46,593 --> 00:19:48,343
I guess there is no good way.

379
00:19:48,439 --> 00:19:50,954
Sometimes, no matter how hard
you try to do the right thing,

380
00:19:51,050 --> 00:19:55,092
you just end up flat on your back,
flailing around in a big pile of horse crap.

381
00:19:55,187 --> 00:19:58,434
- You saw it?
- My phone gets the Internet now.

382
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:02,188
It's okay.

383
00:20:02,731 --> 00:20:04,705
<i>And that's how it ended with Natalie.</i>

384
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:07,474
<i>No happily-ever-after.
Just a whole lot of hurt.</i>

385
00:20:07,570 --> 00:20:11,198
<i>And, just like that, all those
wonderful memories were replaced...</i>

386
00:20:11,294 --> 00:20:12,535
<i>by this one.</i>

387
00:20:12,630 --> 00:20:16,514
<i>But, you know, bad as that night was,
within a year Natalie was married.</i>

388
00:20:16,609 --> 00:20:18,933
<i>And now she has three beautiful children.</i>

389
00:20:19,029 --> 00:20:23,580
<i>So that's the upside of hurt.
Sometimes it happens for a reason.</i>

390
00:20:23,675 --> 00:20:25,583
Wow.

391
00:20:25,777 --> 00:20:27,909
So you got beat up by a girl?

392
00:20:28,005 --> 00:20:30,201
Is that all you're taking away
from this story?

393
00:20:30,297 --> 00:20:32,673
You got beat up by a girl.

394
00:20:33,289 --> 00:20:35,235
Hey, she knew Krav Maga.
