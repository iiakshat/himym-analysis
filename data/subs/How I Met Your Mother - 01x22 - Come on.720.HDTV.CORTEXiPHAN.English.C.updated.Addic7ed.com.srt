00:00:12,952 --> 00:00:17,134
<i>It was May of 2006
in New York City, and life was good.</i>

3
00:00:17,229 --> 00:00:20,075
<i>But everything was about to change.</i>

4
00:00:20,102 --> 00:00:22,431
So what do you think?

5
00:00:24,028 --> 00:00:25,941
Robin again?

6
00:00:26,072 --> 00:00:31,338
Ted, the universe clearly does not want
you and Robin to be together.

7
00:00:31,434 --> 00:00:34,243
Don't piss off the universe.
The universe will slap you.

8
00:00:34,339 --> 00:00:35,456
Don't you think the universe...

9
00:00:35,552 --> 00:00:37,690
has more important things
to worry about than my dating life?

10
00:00:37,786 --> 00:00:41,680
Unless your dating life is the glue
holding the entire universe together.

11
00:00:41,776 --> 00:00:44,866
Whoa, chills. Anybody else get chills?

12
00:00:45,894 --> 00:00:48,959
Look, I realize we've been
down this road before,

13
00:00:49,054 --> 00:00:53,140
but the fact is, whatever I do,
it all keeps coming back to Robin.

14
00:00:53,236 --> 00:00:55,499
So I gotta do this.

15
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:59,715
- What the hell?
- That wasn't me.

16
00:00:59,811 --> 00:01:01,724
That was the universe.

17
00:01:02,621 --> 00:01:04,567
<i>The funny thing was,
at that very moment,</i>

18
00:01:04,663 --> 00:01:06,707
<i>the universe was working on something.
</i>

19
00:01:06,802 --> 00:01:07,983
<i>A storm.</i>

20
00:01:08,078 --> 00:01:11,877
So Tropical Storm Willie
is gonna be with us at least until Monday.

21
00:01:11,973 --> 00:01:14,463
It's gonna rain cats and dogs, folks.

22
00:01:14,559 --> 00:01:16,346
So don't step in a poodle.

23
00:01:16,441 --> 00:01:18,825
- Sandy, Robin?
- Thanks, Lou.

24
00:01:18,932 --> 00:01:19,921
Boy, too bad.

25
00:01:20,017 --> 00:01:22,762
<i>Our big Metro News 1 camping trip
was gonna be this weekend.</i>

26
00:01:22,858 --> 00:01:25,731
Yeah, but camping out in the rain?
No fun. Muddy. Yuck.

27
00:01:25,826 --> 00:01:27,359
Guess we'll have to take a rain check.

28
00:01:27,455 --> 00:01:29,529
And we'll check in
with you tomorrow, New York.

29
00:01:29,625 --> 00:01:31,189
Have a great night.

30
00:01:31,285 --> 00:01:32,881
And we're clear.

31
00:01:32,976 --> 00:01:36,807
Bummer. I was hoping to finally have sex
with you this weekend, Scherbatsky.

32
00:01:36,902 --> 00:01:39,775
Well, I'd give you the
'I don't date co-workers' speech again,

33
00:01:39,871 --> 00:01:42,648
but, God, you must have
that son-of-a-bitch memorized by now.

34
00:01:42,744 --> 00:01:45,618
Shame, though.
It was a pretty hot show tonight.

35
00:01:45,713 --> 00:01:48,682
The rhythmic give and take
of our improvised banter there at the end...

36
00:01:48,777 --> 00:01:50,277
really got my freak juice flowing.

37
00:01:52,371 --> 00:01:53,361
Dude, he is right.

38
00:01:53,456 --> 00:01:55,627
How many times do you have
to watch this crash and burn...

39
00:01:55,723 --> 00:01:58,788
- before you say, 'Enough'?
- One more. One more time.

40
00:01:58,883 --> 00:02:01,150
One more big, beautiful, stupid,
romantic gesture...

41
00:02:01,245 --> 00:02:03,767
and then, whatever she says,
yes or no, that's it.

42
00:02:01,098 --> 00:02:03,620
and then, whatever she says,
yes or no, that's it.

43
00:02:03,716 --> 00:02:05,056
If it's yes, great.

44
00:02:08,459 --> 00:02:11,683
So what's this big, beautiful,
romantic gesture?

45
00:02:11,779 --> 00:02:13,812
I am going to make her...

46
00:02:14,907 --> 00:02:16,821
a mix CD.

47
00:02:17,652 --> 00:02:18,961
No, I'm kidding. I got a plan.

48
00:02:19,056 --> 00:02:20,972
Lily, I'm gonna need the spare key
to Robin's apartment.

49
00:02:21,067 --> 00:02:22,440
I see where this is going.

50
00:02:22,536 --> 00:02:24,355
Ted, waiting naked in a girl's bed...

51
00:02:24,451 --> 00:02:27,419
wearing whipped cream undies
does not work.

52
00:02:27,515 --> 00:02:30,389
Usually. The setting,
Martha's Vineyard, 1999.

53
00:02:30,485 --> 00:02:34,506
The characters, yours truly
and a raven-haired au pair by the...

54
00:02:34,602 --> 00:02:36,166
Universe.

55
00:02:36,262 --> 00:02:38,558
So this plan you speak of.

56
00:02:39,071 --> 00:02:41,465
Remember the first night
Robin and I went out?

57
00:02:41,561 --> 00:02:45,104
<i>I stole a blue French horn for her,
and it almost worked.</i>

58
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:50,485
Yeah, dude, that was awesome.
But how are you ever gonna top that?

59
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:57,809
She should be here any second. So...

60
00:02:57,904 --> 00:03:00,298
We're pretty hungry.
When do we get our pizza?

61
00:03:00,393 --> 00:03:01,479
Enough with the...

62
00:03:01,575 --> 00:03:03,905
We'll go get pizza later, all right?
Just stay...

63
00:03:16,737 --> 00:03:18,650
Damn it.

64
00:03:24,014 --> 00:03:25,420
- Hello?
- Hey, Lily.

65
00:03:25,515 --> 00:03:29,154
I'm locked out of my apartment.
I need to come pick up my extra key.

66
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:31,163
Extra key?

67
00:03:31,867 --> 00:03:33,847
Do I have an extra key to your apartment?

68
00:03:33,942 --> 00:03:35,156
Yes, I gave it to you.

69
00:03:35,251 --> 00:03:38,260
Oh, right. That key. Yeah, I lost it.

70
00:03:38,698 --> 00:03:40,518
Great. Now I gotta go to the locksmith.

71
00:03:40,613 --> 00:03:42,527
No. Wait.

72
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:44,603
Maybe you should just knock.

73
00:03:44,699 --> 00:03:46,008
Knock?

74
00:03:46,103 --> 00:03:47,732
Lily, my dogs aren't that well-trained.

75
00:03:53,286 --> 00:03:54,977
<i>Hello, Lily. This is Janet Kagen,</i>

76
00:03:55,073 --> 00:03:57,723
<i>at the Russell House Art Foundation
here in San Francisco.</i>

77
00:03:57,819 --> 00:04:00,212
<i>I'm pleased to inform you
that we've accepted your application...</i>

78
00:04:00,308 --> 00:04:01,521
<i>for our summer fellowship.</i>

79
00:04:01,617 --> 00:04:03,851
<i>We look forward to hearing from you.
Bye-bye.</i>

80
00:04:03,947 --> 00:04:06,874
Robin, I gotta go. Just knock, okay?

81
00:04:08,895 --> 00:04:10,808
Summer fellowship?

82
00:04:11,001 --> 00:04:13,004
Just knock. Okay.

83
00:04:19,556 --> 00:04:22,135
- Hi.
- Hi.

84
00:04:32,583 --> 00:04:35,804
Robin. I've sort of said this already.

85
00:04:35,903 --> 00:04:39,989
I mean, I've half-said it.
I've tried to say it and I've said it badly.

86
00:04:40,084 --> 00:04:42,524
So this is me, just saying it.

87
00:04:43,053 --> 00:04:44,966
With strings.

88
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:49,341
I'm crazy about you.
I think we should be together.

89
00:04:49,437 --> 00:04:51,350
What do you say?

90
00:04:58,289 --> 00:05:02,502
- What do you say?
- Yes. No. I don't know.

91
00:05:02,918 --> 00:05:04,482
Those are the three options.

92
00:05:04,578 --> 00:05:06,366
- Ted, this is so...
- I know.

93
00:05:06,461 --> 00:05:09,206
<i>I mean, I come home,
I was gonna watch Jeopardy,</i>

94
00:05:09,302 --> 00:05:11,717
and there's a string quartet,

95
00:05:12,207 --> 00:05:14,120
and I have to pee.

96
00:05:14,282 --> 00:05:16,195
Oh, I'm sorry.

97
00:05:16,835 --> 00:05:19,844
- Well, go ahead, we'll wait.
- Great.

98
00:05:30,689 --> 00:05:33,753
Yeah, 'cause when we talked earlier,
you said there'd be pizza.

99
00:05:33,848 --> 00:05:37,320
No, I said I'd get you a pizza afterwards.

100
00:05:37,423 --> 00:05:39,084
Look, could we talk about this later?

101
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:42,839
- I'm sort of professing my love here.
- Sure.

102
00:05:44,222 --> 00:05:46,499
We're not getting any pizza.

103
00:05:48,053 --> 00:05:50,763
Okay. Let's talk.

104
00:05:51,181 --> 00:05:53,094
Okay.

105
00:05:55,267 --> 00:05:58,601
Hey, you guys wanna take five? All right.

106
00:05:58,842 --> 00:06:01,970
Thanks, guys, we just need a minute.
Sort of a big life decision.

107
00:06:02,066 --> 00:06:05,514
Love the blue instruments, though.
Kind of an inside joke.

108
00:06:05,609 --> 00:06:07,523
Thanks.

109
00:06:08,802 --> 00:06:11,404
- You're crazy.
- Right. Come on.

110
00:06:11,419 --> 00:06:13,717
It's not that I haven't thought about this.

111
00:06:13,813 --> 00:06:16,016
You know that I have.
But let's look at this, okay?

112
00:06:16,112 --> 00:06:18,218
We only just started being friends again.

113
00:06:18,314 --> 00:06:20,414
I know. But come on.

114
00:06:20,771 --> 00:06:24,602
And... And we want different things.
That's still there. That's not going away.

115
00:06:24,698 --> 00:06:26,868
I mean, what if we do this
and it doesn't work out...

116
00:06:26,964 --> 00:06:29,071
and I'd lose you as a friend?

117
00:06:29,167 --> 00:06:30,540
I gotta think about this.

118
00:06:30,635 --> 00:06:32,710
Okay, fine. Think about it on the plane.

119
00:06:32,806 --> 00:06:34,306
Let's go to Paris for the weekend.
I'm serious.

120
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:38,615
- I'm kidding. I'm serious.
- I can't go to Paris. I'm going camping.

121
00:06:38,711 --> 00:06:41,041
- Well, I thought that thing was canceled.
- Well, it's back on.

122
00:06:41,137 --> 00:06:44,227
- Since when?
- Since like an hour ago.

123
00:06:44,712 --> 00:06:47,138
Sending the storm
back out into the Atlantic.

124
00:06:47,233 --> 00:06:49,878
So it's blue skies this weekend.

125
00:06:50,548 --> 00:06:52,906
- Sandy, Robin?
- Thanks, Lou.

126
00:06:52,910 --> 00:06:56,976
But that blue sky
isn't without at least one cloud.

127
00:06:57,124 --> 00:06:58,975
I'm sorry to announce
that one week from today

128
00:06:59,071 --> 00:07:01,592
<i>I will be leaving Metro News 1.</i>

129
00:07:01,784 --> 00:07:04,050
It has been an honor
to bring you the news each night,

130
00:07:04,146 --> 00:07:06,636
and read the paper to you each morning.

131
00:07:06,732 --> 00:07:10,211
I will always treasure it.
Good night, New York.

132
00:07:10,307 --> 00:07:11,935
And we're clear.

133
00:07:12,031 --> 00:07:15,283
- You're leaving?
- There. I quit my job.

134
00:07:15,286 --> 00:07:17,936
We're not co-workers.
Will you please have dinner with me?

135
00:07:19,468 --> 00:07:21,543
I'm joking. I got offered a job at CNN.

136
00:07:21,638 --> 00:07:25,246
- Oh, congratulations.
- Congratulations, yourself.

137
00:07:25,342 --> 00:07:27,512
- What do you mean?
- Well, Joe asked me...

138
00:07:27,608 --> 00:07:30,417
who I thought should replace me
as lead anchor.

139
00:07:30,512 --> 00:07:32,426
I told him you.

140
00:07:32,907 --> 00:07:35,556
They're announcing it next week.
Act surprised.

141
00:07:35,652 --> 00:07:38,427
Wow. Thanks.

142
00:07:40,057 --> 00:07:41,142
And, yes.

143
00:07:41,238 --> 00:07:44,409
- Yes, what?
- Yes, let's go get dinner.

144
00:07:45,132 --> 00:07:47,749
How about this weekend
on the camping trip?

145
00:07:47,845 --> 00:07:49,758
I roast a mean weenie.

146
00:07:51,708 --> 00:07:54,868
You're kidding me. No way.
Don't go on this thing.

147
00:07:54,964 --> 00:07:57,517
Ted, I have to go.
It's a company camping trip.

148
00:07:57,613 --> 00:08:00,678
Really? Because it also kind of
sounds like a date with Sandy...

149
00:08:00,773 --> 00:08:01,795
and his weenie.

150
00:08:03,104 --> 00:08:06,682
- I mean, is this not a date?
- I don't know.

151
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:10,637
- So, what, you actually like this guy now?
- I don't know.

152
00:08:10,732 --> 00:08:12,871
- Are you gonna hook up with him?
- I don't know.

153
00:08:12,967 --> 00:08:14,722
- Yes, you do.
- No, Ted, I don't.

154
00:08:14,818 --> 00:08:16,606
And you know what? That's okay.

155
00:08:16,702 --> 00:08:19,510
I don't plan out every second of my life,
like you do.

156
00:08:19,606 --> 00:08:21,170
- I don't plan out every...
- Oh, really?

157
00:08:21,266 --> 00:08:22,863
What is all of this?

158
00:08:22,958 --> 00:08:26,629
I mean, why can't you just say,
'Hey, Robin, let's go get some sushi?'

159
00:08:26,725 --> 00:08:31,449
No, it has to be a string quartet,
and Paris, and flowers, and chocolates,

160
00:08:31,544 --> 00:08:33,619
and 'Let's spend
the rest of our lives together.'

161
00:08:33,715 --> 00:08:36,748
Don't you think
we're a little past sushi at this point?

162
00:08:36,843 --> 00:08:39,589
God, you are so terrified of anything real.

163
00:08:39,684 --> 00:08:43,611
It's like you're floating out in space.
Touch the ground, Robin.

164
00:08:43,706 --> 00:08:46,292
Live in the world, make a mistake.
Make this mistake.

165
00:08:46,388 --> 00:08:47,983
I need to think about this.

166
00:08:48,079 --> 00:08:49,707
Fine.

167
00:08:50,187 --> 00:08:52,100
No. I'm sorry,

168
00:08:52,485 --> 00:08:55,900
I can't do this anymore. I need an answer.

169
00:08:56,731 --> 00:09:00,752
If you want me to say yes right now,
I can't do that.

170
00:09:00,848 --> 00:09:03,857
Well, if it's not yes then it's a no.

171
00:09:06,275 --> 00:09:09,040
Then I guess it's not meant to be.

172
00:09:12,116 --> 00:09:15,532
- Nice try, buddy.
- Good hustle out there.

173
00:09:16,043 --> 00:09:18,500
Look at the bright side.
At least you got some closure.

174
00:09:18,596 --> 00:09:22,108
She's made her choice,
and you can finally move on.

175
00:09:22,203 --> 00:09:23,416
Screw that. This ain't over.

176
00:09:25,012 --> 00:09:27,438
You sat here, in this very booth,
and you said...

177
00:09:27,534 --> 00:09:30,726
I don't care what I said.
This is gonna happen.

178
00:09:30,822 --> 00:09:33,311
She can't say it's not meant to be.
It is meant to be.

179
00:09:33,407 --> 00:09:35,833
And you know why?
'Cause I mean it to be.

180
00:09:40,014 --> 00:09:41,323
- Unpause?
- Unpause.

181
00:09:41,419 --> 00:09:43,111
<i>Let's pause.</i>

182
00:09:43,207 --> 00:09:46,239
<i>See, Marshall and Lily had a rule
that at any point during a fight,</i>

183
00:09:46,335 --> 00:09:49,974
<i>they could pause and take a break.
Their fights often lasted for days.</i>

184
00:09:50,070 --> 00:09:52,336
- A painting fellowship?
- I was never gonna take it.

185
00:09:52,432 --> 00:09:54,954
- In California?
- I was never gonna take it.

186
00:09:55,049 --> 00:09:57,762
Ted, she is going on that camping trip.

187
00:09:57,858 --> 00:09:59,646
Dude, barring some act of God,

188
00:09:59,742 --> 00:10:03,076
Robin's gonna be with Sandy this weekend.

189
00:10:03,795 --> 00:10:05,105
Fine.

190
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:09,998
If an act of God is what it takes,
then an act of God it is.

191
00:10:10,435 --> 00:10:12,631
What are you talking about?

192
00:10:14,042 --> 00:10:15,955
I'm gonna make it rain.

193
00:10:19,317 --> 00:10:21,328
I can't let Robin go camping with this guy.

194
00:10:21,424 --> 00:10:25,063
So how do I keep that from happening?
Simple. I make it rain.

195
00:10:25,158 --> 00:10:29,117
Ted, do you want me to slap you again?
'Cause I kind of enjoyed it the first time.

196
00:10:29,213 --> 00:10:31,001
I might be crazy right now.
No, you know what?

197
00:10:31,096 --> 00:10:33,523
I am definitely crazy right now.
But I have a plan.

198
00:10:33,618 --> 00:10:35,245
That girl you used to go out with, Penelope.

199
00:10:35,341 --> 00:10:37,767
Wasn't she getting her PhD
in Native American culture?

200
00:10:37,863 --> 00:10:39,427
- Yeah.
- Are you still in touch with her?

201
00:10:39,523 --> 00:10:41,598
Sure. I mean,
even though we stopped having sex,

202
00:10:41,693 --> 00:10:43,928
we still get together like once a month
to chat and catch up,

203
00:10:44,024 --> 00:10:45,556
and of course I'm not in touch with her!

204
00:10:45,652 --> 00:10:47,631
Well, you're gonna
need to get in touch with her.

205
00:10:47,727 --> 00:10:51,224
She's gonna teach me
how to do a rain dance.

206
00:10:51,462 --> 00:10:54,552
- Did you just say a rain dance?
- Yes.

207
00:10:54,844 --> 00:10:56,758
- A rain dance?
- Yes.

208
00:10:57,111 --> 00:11:00,169
- A dance to make it rain.
- Yes.

209
00:11:08,475 --> 00:11:10,135
- No, we are not!
- Yes, we are!

210
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:12,241
Ted, you're forcing me
to be the voice of reason.

211
00:11:12,337 --> 00:11:14,939
And it's not a good look for me!

212
00:11:15,434 --> 00:11:17,764
- Why the hell should I help you?
- Come on.

213
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:22,328
I know it didn't work out between us,
but we did have a relationship.

214
00:11:22,424 --> 00:11:25,457
We had sex twice in your car
and then you dumped me.

215
00:11:25,552 --> 00:11:27,748
How is that a relationship?

216
00:11:27,947 --> 00:11:29,351
Twice?

217
00:11:29,447 --> 00:11:31,138
Barney, there is no way I am...

218
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:34,393
Seriously, come on.

219
00:11:35,384 --> 00:11:38,161
Penelope, I really need
to make it rain this weekend.

220
00:11:38,257 --> 00:11:39,757
Why?

221
00:11:39,852 --> 00:11:41,002
There's this girl...

222
00:11:41,098 --> 00:11:43,204
'There's this girl?'

223
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:46,908
You know, the traditional rain dance
is a sacred prayer to nature.

224
00:11:47,003 --> 00:11:49,621
I don't think the Great Spirit
looks too kindly on white dudes...

225
00:11:49,716 --> 00:11:51,312
who co-opt it to get laid.

226
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:53,535
Penelope, this is the girl I love.

227
00:11:53,631 --> 00:11:56,887
If it doesn't rain this weekend,
she's gonna end up with the wrong guy.

228
00:11:56,983 --> 00:11:58,896
Please.

229
00:11:59,952 --> 00:12:03,750
- This wrong guy, is he a huge jackass?
- Absolutely.

230
00:12:03,846 --> 00:12:05,219
- Kind of like Barney?
- Kind of.

231
00:12:05,315 --> 00:12:06,815
- Hey.
- You hit on my mom.

232
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:08,824
We weren't exclusive.

233
00:12:10,709 --> 00:12:11,762
I'm in.

234
00:12:11,858 --> 00:12:14,347
<i>And so the three of us
headed to the roof of my building.</i>

235
00:12:14,443 --> 00:12:15,944
Okay.

236
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:18,051
Crouch down and bend over a little bit.

237
00:12:18,146 --> 00:12:21,179
Wow, it took five shots of tequila
to get you in that position.

238
00:12:21,274 --> 00:12:23,795
I will throw you off this roof.

239
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:26,056
So much of your mom in you.

240
00:12:28,967 --> 00:12:30,915
And she's been throwing up ever since.

241
00:12:31,010 --> 00:12:33,819
So how'd she manage
to eat so much chocolate?

242
00:12:33,915 --> 00:12:36,820
Remember that guy, Ted,
that I was telling you about?

243
00:12:36,916 --> 00:12:39,725
Well, I came home
and I found him waiting in my apartment...

244
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:41,959
with a string quartet and roses
and chocolates...

245
00:12:42,055 --> 00:12:44,253
Oh, that's so sweet.

246
00:12:44,928 --> 00:12:48,598
Okay, yes, it's sweet in theory.
But isn't it also kind of crazy?

247
00:12:48,694 --> 00:12:51,503
I mean, a string quartet in my living room.

248
00:12:51,599 --> 00:12:53,897
- Who does that?
- Nobody does that.

249
00:12:53,993 --> 00:12:57,465
- Exactly.
- No, honey. Nobody does that.

250
00:12:59,515 --> 00:13:02,165
But I guess I'm just a hopeless romantic.

251
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:04,367
I'm gonna put my hand up your dog now.

252
00:13:06,761 --> 00:13:09,155
So you're saying
you would forbid me from going.

253
00:13:09,251 --> 00:13:10,815
Forbid? Who said forbid?

254
00:13:10,911 --> 00:13:14,199
I was just reminding you that there's this
wedding coming up in a couple of months,

255
00:13:14,294 --> 00:13:15,794
and I was kind of hoping
you'd save the date.

256
00:13:15,890 --> 00:13:18,093
Look for me,
I'll be the guy in the awesome suit.

257
00:13:18,189 --> 00:13:20,711
I mean, come on, Lily,
it's what you've always wanted.

258
00:13:20,806 --> 00:13:23,137
Yeah, but there's a lot of things
I've always wanted...

259
00:13:23,232 --> 00:13:25,753
and I haven't done any of them.

260
00:13:26,168 --> 00:13:30,669
I'm sorry. I just need to do this
before settling down forever.

261
00:13:30,765 --> 00:13:31,787
So now we've gone...

262
00:13:31,882 --> 00:13:34,500
from 'I was never gonna do it'
to 'I need to do this.'

263
00:13:34,595 --> 00:13:36,543
Did I leave the room at some point?
When did that happen?

264
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:38,490
Oh, maybe when you said
you wouldn't let me do it.

265
00:13:38,586 --> 00:13:39,990
I never said that!

266
00:13:40,086 --> 00:13:41,746
You know, if you're having
these kind of doubts now,

267
00:13:41,841 --> 00:13:43,023
what's gonna change in three months?

268
00:13:43,118 --> 00:13:44,172
Maybe we just shouldn't get married at all.

269
00:13:44,267 --> 00:13:46,205
Maybe not.

270
00:13:48,257 --> 00:13:50,171
- Pause.
- Pause.

271
00:13:50,301 --> 00:13:52,694
- So are you just like starving?
- Totally.

272
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:54,703
Red Lobster?

273
00:13:55,376 --> 00:13:57,834
Oh, lobster, lobster, lobster,
you are delicious.

274
00:13:57,929 --> 00:14:01,409
Oh, God, I love butter sauce.
There's nothing bad about it.

275
00:14:01,504 --> 00:14:03,771
Say something bad about butter sauce,
I dare you.

276
00:14:03,866 --> 00:14:05,780
I wouldn't dare.

277
00:14:06,037 --> 00:14:07,601
Marshall, no.

278
00:14:07,697 --> 00:14:11,176
We're on pause.
There's no crying in pause land.

279
00:14:11,272 --> 00:14:12,996
Pause land is a magical place...

280
00:14:13,091 --> 00:14:17,157
with popcorn shrimp mounds
and butter sauce rivers.

281
00:14:17,816 --> 00:14:19,730
Damn it!

282
00:14:31,844 --> 00:14:33,758
Ted, this is funny.

283
00:14:34,206 --> 00:14:36,120
Still funny.

284
00:14:36,377 --> 00:14:38,738
Still... And now it's sad.

285
00:14:40,016 --> 00:14:42,665
Hey, Penelope,
you sure I'm doing this right?

286
00:14:42,761 --> 00:14:44,674
I think so.

287
00:14:44,676 --> 00:14:47,613
Does it look anything like a real rain dance?

288
00:14:47,708 --> 00:14:49,622
I think so.

289
00:14:49,624 --> 00:14:54,909
Hey, Penelope, have you ever actually seen
a rain dance performed?

290
00:14:55,082 --> 00:14:56,996
No.

291
00:14:58,082 --> 00:15:00,445
- No?
- I've read extensively on the subject.

292
00:15:00,541 --> 00:15:02,999
First-hand accounts,
theoretical criticisms, anthropological...

293
00:15:03,094 --> 00:15:05,696
Have you ever seen a rain dance?

294
00:15:06,542 --> 00:15:08,455
I've seen a film strip.

295
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:10,277
Terrific. Look, I should run.

296
00:15:10,373 --> 00:15:13,915
<i>I'm getting brain surgery from some guy
who's seen a couple episodes of ER.</i>

297
00:15:14,011 --> 00:15:15,256
I can't believe this.

298
00:15:15,352 --> 00:15:18,193
We've been up here for the past hour
making complete asses of ourselves.

299
00:15:18,289 --> 00:15:20,972
What do you mean 'we,' white man?

300
00:15:23,811 --> 00:15:25,724
How did we get here?

301
00:15:26,492 --> 00:15:28,727
A couple of days ago,
the biggest problem in my life was,

302
00:15:28,823 --> 00:15:31,791
'Did Ted eat the last pudding snack pack
in the fridge?'

303
00:15:31,887 --> 00:15:34,977
- Think there's still one left.
- Dibs.

304
00:15:38,686 --> 00:15:40,599
- Unpause?
- Unpause.

305
00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:44,620
Look, I know this sucks.

306
00:15:45,165 --> 00:15:47,720
It's just something I'm going through.

307
00:15:47,815 --> 00:15:52,859
I'm not asking you to understand it.
I'm not asking you to be happy about it.

308
00:15:52,954 --> 00:15:55,719
I'm just asking you to support it.

309
00:15:57,391 --> 00:15:59,668
Look, I want to, Lily, okay?

310
00:16:00,009 --> 00:16:02,969
I really do. But I just can't.

311
00:16:03,648 --> 00:16:05,467
- Why not?
- Because you're scaring the hell out of me.

312
00:16:05,563 --> 00:16:07,319
That's why not.

313
00:16:07,414 --> 00:16:09,010
What if you decide to go be a painter,

314
00:16:09,106 --> 00:16:11,149
and then you realize
I don't fit into your life anymore,

315
00:16:11,245 --> 00:16:13,320
and three months becomes forever?

316
00:16:13,415 --> 00:16:16,160
Can you promise me that
that's not gonna happen?

317
00:16:16,256 --> 00:16:18,075
- Marshall...
- 'Cause if you can't promise me that,

318
00:16:18,171 --> 00:16:19,257
we should just break up right now.

319
00:16:19,352 --> 00:16:20,534
I'm not gonna wait around
for three months...

320
00:16:20,629 --> 00:16:23,313
just to have my heart ripped out.

321
00:16:24,651 --> 00:16:26,565
Marshall, I love you.

322
00:16:27,844 --> 00:16:30,206
Can you promise me that
that's not gonna happen?

323
00:16:30,301 --> 00:16:32,439
- Pause.
- No, Lily, we cannot pause this anymore.

324
00:16:32,535 --> 00:16:34,227
Can you promise me that
that's not gonna happen?

325
00:16:34,323 --> 00:16:37,413
- Pause!
- Why do you want me to pause?

326
00:16:39,111 --> 00:16:41,377
That's just a great use
of the pause function, baby.

327
00:16:41,473 --> 00:16:43,386
Thank you.

328
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:52,132
Hey, Ted, what you doing?

329
00:16:52,233 --> 00:16:53,860
A rain dance.

330
00:16:53,956 --> 00:16:58,202
Dude, that's not a rain dance.
That's a fat kid with a bee in his pants.

331
00:16:58,297 --> 00:17:01,649
Look, I highly doubt the Great Spirit's
a stickler for choreography.

332
00:17:01,745 --> 00:17:03,565
It's the thought that counts.

333
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:05,895
She's leaving in half an hour.

334
00:17:08,033 --> 00:17:11,544
Dude, these are your awesome years,
you're wasting them on this girl.

335
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:14,290
- This isn't gonna work.
- Yeah. I know that.

336
00:17:14,385 --> 00:17:17,418
- Well, then why are you doing it?
- Because I love her.

337
00:17:17,514 --> 00:17:18,727
I love her!

338
00:17:18,822 --> 00:17:20,610
I told her that the first night we went out,

339
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:23,195
and here it is, eight months later,
and nothing's changed.

340
00:17:23,291 --> 00:17:26,196
So, yes, I know this isn't gonna work.

341
00:17:26,292 --> 00:17:28,205
But it has to work!

342
00:17:28,526 --> 00:17:30,378
Do you hear me, universe?

343
00:17:30,473 --> 00:17:32,588
This is Ted Mosby talking!

344
00:17:33,122 --> 00:17:35,036
Give me some rain!

345
00:17:35,964 --> 00:17:37,877
Come on!

346
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:40,303
Come on!

347
00:17:40,719 --> 00:17:42,689
Come on!

348
00:17:45,955 --> 00:17:47,868
Oh, come on!

349
00:18:00,095 --> 00:18:02,968
Pushing the front
back into the tri-state area,

350
00:18:03,064 --> 00:18:05,490
<i>and giving Manhattan
one of its worst storms...</i>

351
00:18:05,586 --> 00:18:06,927
<i>in over a decade.</i>

352
00:18:07,022 --> 00:18:09,137
How about that? He did it.

353
00:18:29,686 --> 00:18:31,786
Robin. Hey, Robin.

354
00:18:38,368 --> 00:18:40,060
Oh, thank God you're here.

355
00:18:40,155 --> 00:18:42,007
My camping trip got rained out.

356
00:18:42,103 --> 00:18:44,016
I know. I'm sorry.

357
00:18:44,018 --> 00:18:46,636
- It's not your fault.
- Yeah, it is.

358
00:18:46,731 --> 00:18:47,849
Come down here.

359
00:18:47,944 --> 00:18:49,796
It's pouring. You come up.

360
00:18:49,891 --> 00:18:52,412
No, you have to come down here.

361
00:18:52,764 --> 00:18:54,392
- Why?
- Why?

362
00:18:54,488 --> 00:18:57,392
Because I made it rain.
That's what I did today.

363
00:18:57,488 --> 00:19:01,798
And that's enough.
I've done my part, now get down here!

364
00:19:01,893 --> 00:19:04,658
I'm not dressed, Ted. You come up.

365
00:19:04,702 --> 00:19:06,937
I'm not coming up there, Robin, I'm not.

366
00:19:07,033 --> 00:19:09,228
You have to come down here.

367
00:19:27,334 --> 00:19:29,367
- I was gonna...
- I know.

368
00:19:47,316 --> 00:19:49,838
<i>And that's how Robin and I
ended up together.</i>

369
00:19:49,934 --> 00:19:53,062
<i>Turns out all I had to do was make it rain.</i>

370
00:19:53,158 --> 00:19:55,839
<i>As I rode home the next morning,
the city looked the same,</i>

371
00:19:55,935 --> 00:19:58,712
<i>the people looked the same,
it all looked the same.</i>

372
00:19:58,808 --> 00:20:00,117
<i>But it wasn't.</i>

373
00:20:00,212 --> 00:20:03,627
<i>In just one night, everything had changed.</i>
