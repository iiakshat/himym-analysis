<i>When you meet someone
special suddenly life is full of firsts.</i>

3
00:00:16,467 --> 00:00:17,845
<i>The first kiss.</i>

4
00:00:17,941 --> 00:00:19,607
<i>The first night together.</i>

5
00:00:19,703 --> 00:00:21,658
<i>The first weekend together.</i>

6
00:00:21,754 --> 00:00:26,432
<i>For me, all those firsts happened
within 48 hours of meeting Victoria.</i>

7
00:00:26,529 --> 00:00:29,573
They've gotta come out soon. It's Monday.

8
00:00:29,669 --> 00:00:32,007
Do you think they've been in there
the whole time?

9
00:00:32,103 --> 00:00:34,859
I don't know whether to be proud
or concerned.

10
00:00:34,955 --> 00:00:37,567
Maybe they're not even in there.

11
00:00:40,145 --> 00:00:42,065
- Morning.
- Hey, guys.

12
00:00:42,388 --> 00:00:45,304
- I'm just gonna ignore that.
- Thank you.

13
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:47,515
- I wish you could stay.
- I know. Me, too.

14
00:00:47,611 --> 00:00:49,565
But I have to go to work,
and you have that meeting.

15
00:00:49,661 --> 00:00:54,211
- Call you afterwards?
- I'll inappropriately text you during.

16
00:00:54,307 --> 00:00:55,525
- Bye.
- Bye.

17
00:00:55,621 --> 00:00:57,319
- Bye.
- Oh, Victoria. You're here...

18
00:00:57,415 --> 00:00:59,336
Toodle-oo!

19
00:01:00,715 --> 00:01:02,317
Two days straight!

20
00:01:02,413 --> 00:01:05,169
Wow! Your room must smell
like a monkey cage.

21
00:01:05,265 --> 00:01:06,900
Come on, give us a number.
Lily guessed eight,

22
00:01:06,996 --> 00:01:10,103
- but I know my boy got the double digits!
- Zero.

23
00:01:10,199 --> 00:01:11,160
- What?
- What?

24
00:01:11,256 --> 00:01:12,634
Guys, we just met.

25
00:01:12,730 --> 00:01:15,550
And we both screwed up relationships
in the past by jumping in too quick.

26
00:01:15,646 --> 00:01:17,793
So we talked about it
and we decided to take this one slow.

27
00:01:17,889 --> 00:01:20,228
- Her idea.
- Totally her idea!

28
00:01:20,324 --> 00:01:22,215
But I don't know. I'm really into this girl.

29
00:01:22,311 --> 00:01:28,351
And if going slow is what it takes
to make this happen, I say, bring it on.

30
00:01:28,526 --> 00:01:30,192
I don't feel so good.

31
00:01:30,288 --> 00:01:33,205
It's like my testicles
mixed pop rocks and soda.

32
00:01:33,301 --> 00:01:35,511
I can't believe she's making you wait
a whole month.

33
00:01:35,607 --> 00:01:36,858
I would never put up with that.

34
00:01:36,954 --> 00:01:38,908
You've only had sex with one girl
in your whole life.

35
00:01:39,004 --> 00:01:40,190
Burn!

36
00:01:40,286 --> 00:01:42,336
Ted, the only reason to wait
a month for sex...

37
00:01:42,432 --> 00:01:45,411
is if the girl is 17 years, 11 months old.

38
00:01:45,507 --> 00:01:47,783
Good news! I don't have to cover
the cat show tomorrow night.

39
00:01:47,879 --> 00:01:49,033
Who's up for hanging out?

40
00:01:49,129 --> 00:01:51,051
Oh, I can't.
I'm taking Victoria out for dinner.

41
00:01:51,147 --> 00:01:53,966
Oh, we can't.
It's our nine-year anniversary.

42
00:01:54,062 --> 00:01:58,307
Wow! Nine years?
Your relationship's a fourth grader.

43
00:01:58,388 --> 00:02:00,182
- Congrats.
- Thanks.

44
00:02:00,278 --> 00:02:03,098
We're going to the Berkshires
for the maple syrup harvest.

45
00:02:03,194 --> 00:02:06,879
<i>It's one of New York magazine's
top five romantic getaways on a budget.</i>

46
00:02:06,975 --> 00:02:09,750
Who says sexual can't be sensible?

47
00:02:09,955 --> 00:02:12,614
Well, looks like it's gonna be
just you and me.

48
00:02:12,711 --> 00:02:14,216
Really?

49
00:02:14,312 --> 00:02:17,414
Actually, I was talking to my martini.

50
00:02:19,887 --> 00:02:20,000
- Ready to go?
- Hell, yeah.

51
00:02:20,096 --> 00:02:21,810
- Ready to go?
- Hell, yeah.

52
00:02:21,906 --> 00:02:24,437
Nothing better than a weekend
at a good bed-and-breakfast.

53
00:02:24,533 --> 00:02:28,451
Yeah. Waking up for breakfast
at 7:00 a.m. Sharp.

54
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:32,511
Complimenting the owners
on their collection of needlepoint geese.

55
00:02:32,607 --> 00:02:34,594
Awkward conversations
with middle-aged couples...

56
00:02:34,690 --> 00:02:36,975
trying to stave off divorce.

57
00:02:38,022 --> 00:02:41,579
Yeah, well, we'd better get going.
It's like a four-hour drive.

58
00:02:41,675 --> 00:02:44,450
And it's supposed to rain tonight.

59
00:02:46,289 --> 00:02:48,467
- Or we could just stay home.
- Maybe watch some TV?

60
00:02:48,564 --> 00:02:51,576
- Order in some Chinese.
- Szechwan Garden.

61
00:02:51,672 --> 00:02:53,242
- Are we really bailing?
- Hell, yeah.

62
00:02:53,338 --> 00:02:55,950
Good, 'cause this thing's empty.

63
00:03:01,091 --> 00:03:04,601
$100 says
when you turn around I say, 'Wow!'

64
00:03:05,673 --> 00:03:08,428
Barney, this is the third time
you've hit on me by accident!

65
00:03:08,524 --> 00:03:10,863
It's one of the many risks
of the blind approach.

66
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:14,356
It's usually a two-man operation
where Ted signals if the target is hot.

67
00:03:14,452 --> 00:03:17,625
But Ted's too busy
being in a lesbian relationship.

68
00:03:17,721 --> 00:03:21,405
Why don't you just check out
the girl's reflection in the bar mirror?

69
00:03:21,501 --> 00:03:24,025
You can't... Wow!

70
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:26,592
Hey! What's taking so long?

71
00:03:27,076 --> 00:03:30,341
- I gotta go.
- Not so fast, Scherbatsky.

72
00:03:30,344 --> 00:03:33,645
I like the way you think. That mirror thing.

73
00:03:33,741 --> 00:03:35,661
Simple. Elegant.

74
00:03:36,303 --> 00:03:38,344
Okay, limited time offer.

75
00:03:38,419 --> 00:03:40,790
I need a bro,
for my bro-ings-on about town.

76
00:03:40,886 --> 00:03:43,661
How would you like to be said bro?

77
00:03:43,673 --> 00:03:45,211
Well, as tempting as that sounds,

78
00:03:45,307 --> 00:03:47,646
I'm hanging out with my friend
who just got dumped.

79
00:03:47,742 --> 00:03:53,374
She really needs some support,
or a stranger's tongue down her throat.

80
00:03:53,766 --> 00:03:55,686
That seems healthy.

81
00:03:55,976 --> 00:03:57,935
All right! Guess I'm in.

82
00:04:00,815 --> 00:04:04,267
So, one more week and it'll be a month.

83
00:04:04,724 --> 00:04:08,657
Really, are you sure? Wow.
That snuck up on me.

84
00:04:08,921 --> 00:04:10,171
Oh, come on!

85
00:04:10,267 --> 00:04:12,766
The 18th can't get here fast enough.

86
00:04:12,862 --> 00:04:14,528
Wait, the 18th?

87
00:04:14,624 --> 00:04:18,853
Oh, crap! I can't believe I forgot this.
I'm gonna be out of town on the 18th.

88
00:04:18,949 --> 00:04:23,560
Oh, well, we can just wait
until you get back.

89
00:04:23,659 --> 00:04:26,480
I mean, the whole point
was not to rush into this.

90
00:04:26,576 --> 00:04:28,754
Yeah. Or we could do it tonight.

91
00:04:28,851 --> 00:04:30,771
75th and Amsterdam.

92
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:39,834
I'm so glad we decided to just stay home.

93
00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:41,660
Oh, I know. Can you imagine if we'd gone?

94
00:04:41,756 --> 00:04:43,871
We'd be just getting there now,
all tired and cranky.

95
00:04:43,967 --> 00:04:46,627
And yet, we'd feel obligated to have sex.

96
00:04:46,723 --> 00:04:50,232
Yeah, for 89 bucks a night, we're doing it.

97
00:04:52,618 --> 00:04:55,213
I would like to propose a toast...

98
00:04:55,309 --> 00:04:58,982
to the most
awesomely mellow anniversary ever.

99
00:05:07,164 --> 00:05:09,343
I'm so glad you have to go
to your parents next weekend.

100
00:05:09,439 --> 00:05:12,355
I'm so glad your roommates
are out of town.

101
00:05:12,451 --> 00:05:14,213
Oh, my God! What are they doing home?

102
00:05:14,309 --> 00:05:16,268
They think we went away.

103
00:05:18,506 --> 00:05:21,324
Oh, it is on for my boy Ted!

104
00:05:21,422 --> 00:05:23,729
But we didn't go away.
We're in the bathroom.

105
00:05:23,825 --> 00:05:26,645
Well, they don't know that.
All we have to do is hide out in here...

106
00:05:26,741 --> 00:05:29,817
until Ted moves his mojo into the bedroom.

107
00:05:29,913 --> 00:05:32,092
But I don't want to hide out in here.

108
00:05:32,188 --> 00:05:35,455
Honey, Ted has been going out of his mind
waiting for this.

109
00:05:35,551 --> 00:05:37,859
If we go out there and spoil the mood,
it's not gonna happen.

110
00:05:37,955 --> 00:05:39,813
Then one of us is gonna
have to have sex with Ted.

111
00:05:39,909 --> 00:05:42,358
And, not gonna be me.

112
00:05:42,857 --> 00:05:44,778
Okay, fine.

113
00:05:46,125 --> 00:05:48,410
I guess I'll actually floss.

114
00:05:54,519 --> 00:05:56,090
You suited up!

115
00:05:56,186 --> 00:05:59,807
Well, I figured if I'm gonna do this,
I'm gonna do this right.

116
00:05:59,903 --> 00:06:01,665
Emilio, the woman will have...

117
00:06:01,761 --> 00:06:04,004
I'll have a Johnnie Walker Blue, neat,

118
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:06,712
and a Montecristo No. 2. Thanks.

119
00:06:07,753 --> 00:06:10,691
The No. 2. A.k. A the Torpedo.

120
00:06:10,797 --> 00:06:13,735
Or, as the rulers call it, Piramide.

121
00:06:14,865 --> 00:06:18,839
My father was a cigar fanatic.
It was the only way to get his attention.

122
00:06:18,935 --> 00:06:21,239
Father issues. Hot.

123
00:06:21,787 --> 00:06:25,460
I know.
I was this close to being a huge slut.

124
00:06:25,471 --> 00:06:27,938
Slut would have been better.
But I'll settle for bro.

125
00:06:28,034 --> 00:06:31,623
Especially now that Ted's with Victoria
and can't drink.

126
00:06:31,719 --> 00:06:35,236
Because he's pregnant.
'Cause he's the girl.

127
00:06:36,301 --> 00:06:41,043
Oh, come on. Ted can't be pregnant.
You need to have sex to get pregnant.

128
00:06:41,139 --> 00:06:43,990
What up! Freeze frame, high five!

129
00:06:47,663 --> 00:06:50,683
I think this may be a perfect moment.

130
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:54,653
- I wish we could hold on to it forever.
- No.

131
00:06:54,696 --> 00:06:58,413
Because the beauty of a moment
is that it's fleeting.

132
00:06:58,509 --> 00:07:02,427
By its very nature,
it slips through our fingers.

133
00:07:03,091 --> 00:07:05,866
Making it that much more precious.

134
00:07:07,512 --> 00:07:08,986
That is bad.

135
00:07:09,082 --> 00:07:13,081
That is like
high-school-literary-magazine bad!

136
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,619
And they're not even high.

137
00:07:15,715 --> 00:07:17,733
And it's actually working.

138
00:07:17,829 --> 00:07:21,729
Yeah, super slowly.
God, close the deal already.

139
00:07:22,059 --> 00:07:24,814
It's been like 45 minutes.
We could've had sex three times by now.

140
00:07:24,910 --> 00:07:27,114
- Yeah, try five!
- What up.

141
00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:30,581
Hey, maybe we should just go out there.

142
00:07:30,678 --> 00:07:33,113
No way! We can't go out there now.

143
00:07:33,209 --> 00:07:36,029
They'll know that we've been
sitting in the bathroom the whole time.

144
00:07:36,125 --> 00:07:38,410
- It'll be too weird.
- Fine.

145
00:07:39,553 --> 00:07:43,879
But if we're stuck in here,
I'm turning up the volume.

146
00:07:49,422 --> 00:07:51,342
I want to know you.

147
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:54,157
Like, know your soul.

148
00:07:55,445 --> 00:07:57,488
Ted, what makes you cry?

149
00:07:58,457 --> 00:08:03,191
Honey, could you hold my hair back?
I think I'm gonna hurl.

150
00:08:04,288 --> 00:08:07,716
So, what do you and Ted
usually do after the cigar bar?

151
00:08:07,812 --> 00:08:10,664
Are you kidding? Ted's never been here.

152
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:14,509
You've already flown higher and faster
than he ever did.

153
00:08:14,605 --> 00:08:16,526
- Still.
- What?

154
00:08:19,795 --> 00:08:24,448
There is one other thing we could do.
If you're up for it.

155
00:08:28,127 --> 00:08:30,209
I had no idea laser tag still existed!

156
00:08:30,305 --> 00:08:32,260
Yeah, well, enjoy it
before it becomes cool again.

157
00:08:32,356 --> 00:08:34,407
- I give it two months.
- Oh, I believe it. This is awesome!

158
00:08:34,503 --> 00:08:36,104
Okay, follow my lead, stay low,

159
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:38,796
and never underestimate
a 12-year-old with a...

160
00:08:38,892 --> 00:08:41,259
Scherbatsky! You gotta focus!

161
00:08:42,256 --> 00:08:44,980
- You just saved my life, didn't you?
- Thank me later.

162
00:08:45,076 --> 00:08:48,472
Let's keep moving.
These little bastards are everywhere.

163
00:08:53,214 --> 00:08:55,585
He's just staring into her eyes!

164
00:08:55,681 --> 00:08:58,982
I don't know. We used to be
even more nauseatingly into each other...

165
00:08:59,078 --> 00:09:02,179
than Ted and Victoria. Now look at us.

166
00:09:02,185 --> 00:09:05,678
Yeah, now we just make fun
of people like that.

167
00:09:05,774 --> 00:09:07,733
It's the circle of life.

168
00:09:08,081 --> 00:09:10,001
I'm serious, Marshall.

169
00:09:10,164 --> 00:09:13,079
I mean, we couldn't even get it up
to go on our big trip.

170
00:09:13,175 --> 00:09:16,475
And now we're celebrating our anniversary
stuck in a bathroom.

171
00:09:16,571 --> 00:09:19,167
Well, it's not fair to compare us
to Ted and Victoria.

172
00:09:19,263 --> 00:09:21,378
I mean, this is their first time.

173
00:09:21,474 --> 00:09:24,390
Yeah, but we could still have
some more romance.

174
00:09:24,486 --> 00:09:28,567
Now you just say, 'Wanna do it,'
and I say, 'Yeah.'

175
00:09:29,355 --> 00:09:31,276
- Wanna...
- No!

176
00:09:33,168 --> 00:09:35,699
Maybe we're just out of firsts.

177
00:09:45,408 --> 00:09:48,673
Looks like they're about to have theirs.

178
00:09:53,290 --> 00:09:55,020
Should we take this to the bedroom?

179
00:09:55,116 --> 00:09:57,037
- Yes!
- Yes!

180
00:09:57,231 --> 00:09:58,256
Yes.

181
00:09:58,352 --> 00:10:00,273
- Yes!
- Yes!

182
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:04,989
No! No, don't answer it.

183
00:10:06,811 --> 00:10:09,150
You can answer it. We have all night.

184
00:10:09,246 --> 00:10:14,340
- You're answering it? He's answering it!
- No! Do her! Do her now!

185
00:10:14,436 --> 00:10:16,558
Sure. Good luck with that.

186
00:10:18,057 --> 00:10:19,978
Sorry about that.

187
00:10:20,172 --> 00:10:21,967
How about a little more wine?

188
00:10:22,063 --> 00:10:24,756
- I'll get another bottle.
- Okay.

189
00:10:26,067 --> 00:10:30,148
I need a drink.
Do we have any cough syrup in here?

190
00:10:36,609 --> 00:10:39,236
- Ambush! Ambush! Ambush!
- Oh, God!

191
00:10:39,332 --> 00:10:41,511
These brats have us
completely surrounded!

192
00:10:41,607 --> 00:10:43,729
I counted nine, maybe ten.

193
00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:45,837
I'll lay down some cover fire.
You make a run for it.

194
00:10:45,933 --> 00:10:47,118
No! Leave no man behind.

195
00:10:47,214 --> 00:10:49,073
Either we all get out of here,
or no one does.

196
00:10:49,169 --> 00:10:51,796
- But, I...
- Don't be a hero, Scherbatsky!

197
00:10:51,892 --> 00:10:54,014
See you on the other side.

198
00:10:57,082 --> 00:10:59,003
Mother!

199
00:11:03,491 --> 00:11:05,989
Damn. Wanna go get a soft pretzel?

200
00:11:06,086 --> 00:11:08,006
- Yeah.
- All right.

201
00:11:09,611 --> 00:11:11,757
Marshall, what happened to us?

202
00:11:11,853 --> 00:11:16,114
I mean, we used to just stare
into each others' eyes all night long.

203
00:11:16,210 --> 00:11:18,131
Have we lost that?

204
00:11:19,062 --> 00:11:20,983
Maybe.

205
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:26,186
But I think I just found it.

206
00:11:26,752 --> 00:11:28,673
Right here.

207
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:35,111
Baby, I'm giving you sexy smoldering
with just-a-hint-of-crazy eyes.

208
00:11:37,037 --> 00:11:41,298
Okay, well,
get ready for my sex-ray vision.

209
00:11:47,034 --> 00:11:49,148
Did you remember to pick up
the dry cleaning?

210
00:11:49,244 --> 00:11:50,462
- Oh, damn it!
- It's all right.

211
00:11:50,558 --> 00:11:55,210
- We can do this. We can do this.
- Let's just hold hands.

212
00:11:57,255 --> 00:11:59,175
This is nice.

213
00:11:59,465 --> 00:12:01,386
Yeah.

214
00:12:02,509 --> 00:12:06,182
You love that move!
It's the classic Marshall.

215
00:12:06,194 --> 00:12:08,947
Great. We totally suck at this.

216
00:12:09,046 --> 00:12:11,769
And we really,
really need to get out of here!

217
00:12:11,865 --> 00:12:13,785
Well, we can't.

218
00:12:13,916 --> 00:12:17,312
Baby, there's something I have to do.
And if I do it in front of you,

219
00:12:17,408 --> 00:12:20,868
it'll change the entire nature
of our relationship.

220
00:12:20,964 --> 00:12:23,750
- What is it?
- I have to pee.

221
00:12:27,167 --> 00:12:28,866
This is bad.

222
00:12:28,962 --> 00:12:32,133
We've gone nine years
without peeing in front of each other.

223
00:12:32,229 --> 00:12:35,177
You always think there'll be more time.

224
00:12:35,273 --> 00:12:36,524
Look at us.

225
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:40,688
We're basically an old married couple
and we're not even married yet.

226
00:12:40,784 --> 00:12:42,771
The flame of our romance is flickering...

227
00:12:42,867 --> 00:12:46,616
and if I pee all over it,
it might go out forever!

228
00:12:46,712 --> 00:12:48,666
How much longer do you think
you can hold it?

229
00:12:48,762 --> 00:12:53,985
<i>I drank a Big Gulp of Mountain Dew
during that Quantum Leapmarathon.</i>

230
00:12:54,081 --> 00:12:56,001
Oh, boy.

231
00:12:58,054 --> 00:13:00,457
Playing laser tag really takes me back.

232
00:13:00,553 --> 00:13:04,654
And you know what game I really miss?
Battleship. I've never lost a game.

233
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:07,827
- Neither have I. Of course, I cheat.
- Oh, yeah. Me, too.

234
00:13:07,923 --> 00:13:10,582
The trick is to bend the aircraft carrier
so it makes an 'L.'

235
00:13:10,678 --> 00:13:12,953
I always just stacked the ships
on top of each other.

236
00:13:13,049 --> 00:13:16,318
Nice! You know,
we should have a cheaters grudge match.

237
00:13:16,414 --> 00:13:18,454
I think I still have a...

238
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:21,124
Hello. Target acquired.
Hottie by the jukebox.

239
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:23,590
Oh, good eye, Scherbatsky.

240
00:13:23,687 --> 00:13:27,523
I got someone for you. Two o' clock.
Blue shirt.

241
00:13:27,692 --> 00:13:29,197
That's a woman.

242
00:13:29,293 --> 00:13:32,297
Oh, my mistake. Or is it?

243
00:13:33,619 --> 00:13:37,047
- Let's just focus on your target.
- Right.

244
00:13:37,592 --> 00:13:39,512
There. I got this one.

245
00:13:43,712 --> 00:13:46,497
Oh, my God! I love your jeans!

246
00:13:47,141 --> 00:13:50,793
Okay, is this a lesbian bar?
Because that girl with the blue shirt just...

247
00:13:50,889 --> 00:13:53,582
Oh, no. I am all about the dudes.

248
00:13:53,613 --> 00:13:55,343
Although, pickings are pretty slim tonight.

249
00:13:55,439 --> 00:13:59,636
Only hot guy here is blondie in the suit,
and he's playing hard to get.

250
00:13:59,733 --> 00:14:04,303
Really?
'Cause he's totally vibing me right now.

251
00:14:05,147 --> 00:14:06,941
Must be the jeans.

252
00:14:07,037 --> 00:14:12,016
Well, jeans will only get you so far.
I'm going home with him.

253
00:14:12,741 --> 00:14:14,662
We'll see about that.

254
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:28,409
Oh, my God, I hate Ted!
I hate him so much!

255
00:14:28,825 --> 00:14:30,652
Baby, why don't you just go?

256
00:14:30,748 --> 00:14:32,766
Tons of other couples have
peed in front of each other.

257
00:14:32,862 --> 00:14:34,112
I know, but we haven't...

258
00:14:34,208 --> 00:14:37,508
because I want to keep
some of the mystery alive.

259
00:14:37,604 --> 00:14:43,307
- Well, you have farted in front of me.
- Yes, but I always cover it with a cough.

260
00:14:43,403 --> 00:14:45,323
You always do.

261
00:14:51,157 --> 00:14:52,471
- Hey.
- Hey.

262
00:14:52,567 --> 00:14:54,137
Let's get outta here.
Let's go somewhere else.

263
00:14:54,233 --> 00:14:55,546
Well, what happened?

264
00:14:55,642 --> 00:14:58,271
Sometimes I like to do
a little catch-and-release.

265
00:14:58,367 --> 00:15:01,469
- But why?
- Leave no man behind.

266
00:15:02,083 --> 00:15:05,184
Either we all score, or no one scores.

267
00:15:06,152 --> 00:15:07,690
Right on.

268
00:15:07,786 --> 00:15:11,214
- Hey, you wanna go play Battleship?
- Hit!

269
00:15:24,543 --> 00:15:27,449
Ted, I can't wait any longer.

270
00:15:27,555 --> 00:15:32,371
- Should we move to the bedroom?
- There's no time for that.

271
00:15:33,043 --> 00:15:35,189
So, they can suck on each others' fingers
for an hour,

272
00:15:35,285 --> 00:15:37,816
but there's no time
to take two steps to the bedroom?

273
00:15:37,912 --> 00:15:41,667
Baby, I can't hold it in any longer!
It's time!

274
00:15:41,725 --> 00:15:43,646
I know.

275
00:15:44,513 --> 00:15:47,941
- I love you, Marshall.
- I love you, Lily.

276
00:15:53,516 --> 00:15:54,670
Here we go.

277
00:15:54,766 --> 00:15:58,002
You know, Barney, I had a surprisingly
good time bro-ing out tonight.

278
00:15:58,098 --> 00:16:01,174
Well, you make a good bro.
You're a better Ted than Ted.

279
00:16:01,270 --> 00:16:05,852
Hey, in fact, you have just earned yourself
an invite to Marshall's bachelor party.

280
00:16:05,948 --> 00:16:07,870
And you don't even have
to come out of the cake.

281
00:16:07,966 --> 00:16:11,800
Thanks. And thanks
for sticking around tonight.

282
00:16:12,933 --> 00:16:15,047
I hope you're ready
for some hardcore Battleship.

283
00:16:15,143 --> 00:16:17,064
Come on, boys.

284
00:16:18,187 --> 00:16:21,574
'Hardcore'? That's the only way I play.

285
00:16:29,413 --> 00:16:34,347
Oh, I found it. Are you ready to...
What the hell are you doing?

286
00:16:34,443 --> 00:16:38,929
I'm birthday-suiting up. I'm sorry.
Did you want to undress me?

287
00:16:39,025 --> 00:16:41,620
No! I thought we were
just hanging out as friends!

288
00:16:41,716 --> 00:16:44,792
Oh, come on! You have been
throwing yourself at me all night!

289
00:16:44,888 --> 00:16:47,932
What? I did the opposite!
I threw some other girl at you!

290
00:16:48,028 --> 00:16:51,585
You invited me up to your apartment
to 'play Battleship'!

291
00:16:51,681 --> 00:16:54,372
Is that not an internationally
recognized term for sex?

292
00:16:54,468 --> 00:16:56,388
No!

293
00:16:56,936 --> 00:16:58,602
Great.

294
00:16:58,698 --> 00:17:02,208
I hope you're happy.
You sunk my battleship.

295
00:17:06,035 --> 00:17:08,176
I'm okay. Are you okay?

296
00:17:11,513 --> 00:17:15,709
I feel the same.
And, yet, strangely different.

297
00:17:17,025 --> 00:17:20,805
Yeah, I'm happy for my bladder,
yet sad for us.

298
00:17:21,125 --> 00:17:24,807
Look, you had to do it, sweetie. For Ted.

299
00:17:25,579 --> 00:17:28,912
And, hey, look, at least now
we can stay in here as long as it takes.

300
00:17:29,008 --> 00:17:32,309
Yeah, I guess our relationship
had to take a hit,

301
00:17:32,405 --> 00:17:35,425
so a new one out there could blossom.

302
00:17:38,748 --> 00:17:40,543
Oh, crap!

303
00:17:40,639 --> 00:17:42,598
They must've heard that.

304
00:17:43,811 --> 00:17:46,586
Well, I guess we can come out now.

305
00:17:55,288 --> 00:17:57,467
I don't believe it, they're gone.

306
00:17:57,563 --> 00:18:00,283
Good.'Cause I gotta take a whiz.

307
00:18:03,618 --> 00:18:05,924
Okay. You and me? That's insane.

308
00:18:06,021 --> 00:18:07,623
If you even thought about it
for one second...

309
00:18:07,719 --> 00:18:10,571
But I have thought about it for
three seconds, and it makes a lot of sense.

310
00:18:10,667 --> 00:18:12,494
We both think
the marriage-commitment thing's a drag.

311
00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:17,652
We both want something casual and fun.
And we clearly get along really well.

312
00:18:17,748 --> 00:18:20,695
Wow, that actually did make a lot of sense.

313
00:18:20,791 --> 00:18:24,219
- But what about Ted?
- I checked with Ted.

314
00:18:24,477 --> 00:18:26,462
Hey, Ted. So now that things
with you and Victoria are going pretty well

315
00:18:26,558 --> 00:18:28,866
I assume you're probably over
all the girls you were into before, right?

316
00:18:28,962 --> 00:18:30,340
I take your silence as a yes,
so, ergo, therefore,

317
00:18:30,436 --> 00:18:32,294
say I were to hook up with someone,
say, I don't know, Robin,

318
00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:35,722
- you'd be cool with that, right?
- Sure, good luck with that.

319
00:18:35,818 --> 00:18:37,356
Totally gave us his blessing.

320
00:18:37,453 --> 00:18:39,627
- Really?
- Really.

321
00:18:40,561 --> 00:18:43,637
So, Ted didn't care
that you wanted to make a move on me?

322
00:18:43,733 --> 00:18:45,653
Didn't care at all.

323
00:18:53,184 --> 00:18:55,708
- What?
- You like Ted!

324
00:18:55,812 --> 00:18:59,272
- I didn't say that I liked Ted, I...
- You like Ted!

325
00:18:59,368 --> 00:19:02,154
Wow! This is huge.

326
00:19:02,252 --> 00:19:05,616
Barney, I don't like Ted.
He's moved on and I'm really happy for...

327
00:19:05,712 --> 00:19:10,119
Yeah, yeah. Look, are we gonna
play Battleship or what?

328
00:19:17,631 --> 00:19:20,488
You're not gonna tell him, are you?

329
00:19:21,764 --> 00:19:24,965
No. That's the bro code.

330
00:19:26,058 --> 00:19:30,896
A bro doesn't tell a mutual bro
that a third bro has a crush on him.

331
00:19:30,992 --> 00:19:33,267
Just like the third bro
doesn't tell the mutual bro...

332
00:19:33,363 --> 00:19:37,465
that the original bro
went bare pickle in front of her.

333
00:19:37,561 --> 00:19:39,481
It's quid pro bro.

334
00:19:40,572 --> 00:19:41,566
A7.

335
00:19:41,662 --> 00:19:43,582
- Miss.
- Of course.

336
00:19:45,219 --> 00:19:49,953
Well, we still have one frontier left.
Still got the deuce.

337
00:19:50,505 --> 00:19:53,198
You're not making me feel better.

338
00:19:54,702 --> 00:19:57,232
Well, it certainly was a first.

339
00:19:58,611 --> 00:20:00,532
It was, wasn't it?

340
00:20:01,399 --> 00:20:04,745
- We still have firsts.
- Of course we do.

341
00:20:05,179 --> 00:20:08,319
And you know what?
I actually feel closer to you now.

342
00:20:08,415 --> 00:20:10,336
I wanna know you.

343
00:20:10,594 --> 00:20:13,500
Like, know your soul.

344
00:20:14,311 --> 00:20:17,764
Marshall, what makes you cry?

345
00:20:19,310 --> 00:20:22,543
This moment is fleeting...

346
00:20:23,827 --> 00:20:27,336
because it's being chased
by another moment.

347
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:30,088
Oh, just grab my boob already!

348
00:20:33,407 --> 00:20:35,529
Come on, guys. Get a room.
