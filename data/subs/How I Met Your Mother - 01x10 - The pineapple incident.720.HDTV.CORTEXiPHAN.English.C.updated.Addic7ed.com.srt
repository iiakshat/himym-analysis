00:00:12,966 --> 00:00:14,763
<i>Now, I remember
a lot of stories...</i>

3
00:00:14,859 --> 00:00:16,559
<i>from back in the days
before I met your mother.</i>

4
00:00:16,655 --> 00:00:18,740
<i>But there's one story I don't remember.</i>

5
00:00:18,836 --> 00:00:22,333
<i>Uncle Marshall still refers to it
as the 'pineapple incident.'</i>

6
00:00:22,429 --> 00:00:25,510
<i>The night started like any other.
We were downstairs at the bar.</i>

7
00:00:25,606 --> 00:00:26,921
Hey, it's on the house.

8
00:00:27,017 --> 00:00:28,332
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

9
00:00:28,428 --> 00:00:30,835
It's my own concoction.
I call it the Red Dragon.

10
00:00:30,931 --> 00:00:32,599
- Wow.
- Thanks, Carl.

11
00:00:32,695 --> 00:00:33,754
- Really sweet.
- Wow.

12
00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:35,518
- We're not really doing shots, are we?
- I hope not.

13
00:00:35,614 --> 00:00:36,898
- No, no, no.
- Not in a million years.

14
00:00:36,994 --> 00:00:39,079
These look kind of like blood.

15
00:00:39,175 --> 00:00:42,929
Okay, I know that you've all dismissed
this theory before.

16
00:00:43,025 --> 00:00:45,367
But is there any chance
that Carl is a vampire?

17
00:00:45,463 --> 00:00:46,906
- No.
- That's ludicrous.

18
00:00:47,002 --> 00:00:49,826
No, look, I am serious. Think about it.
He always wears black,

19
00:00:49,922 --> 00:00:52,167
we never see him in the daylight,
only after dark.

20
00:00:52,263 --> 00:00:57,738
Oh, my God. That does describe a vampire.
Or, you know, a bartender.

21
00:00:59,321 --> 00:01:02,112
- Well, I should go get dressed.
- Where you going, buddy, hot date?

22
00:01:02,208 --> 00:01:04,485
I'll say. She's going out with a billionaire.

23
00:01:04,582 --> 00:01:06,378
Lily, I told you not to call him that.

24
00:01:06,475 --> 00:01:08,111
Wait, you're really going out
with a billionaire?

25
00:01:08,207 --> 00:01:10,163
He's not a billionaire.
He's a hundred millionaire.

26
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:12,024
Why do people always round up?

27
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:15,585
- So, where's Thurston Howell taking you?
- A charity dinner.

28
00:01:15,681 --> 00:01:19,767
- Yeah, $2,000 a plate.
- $1,500! Stop rounding up.

29
00:01:20,012 --> 00:01:23,380
- And it's for Third World hunger.
- You gonna put out?

30
00:01:23,476 --> 00:01:25,914
What? There's only one reason
he's taking her to this dinner,

31
00:01:26,011 --> 00:01:30,213
and it's not so little Mu Tu
can get his malaria pills.

32
00:01:30,309 --> 00:01:33,823
I think my soul just threw up a little bit.

33
00:01:33,934 --> 00:01:35,859
Well, I'm gonna be late.
You guys have fun.

34
00:01:35,955 --> 00:01:36,982
- Bye.
- See you.

35
00:01:37,078 --> 00:01:39,001
- Bye.
- See you.

36
00:01:39,003 --> 00:01:40,950
- You okay?
- Sure. Why?

37
00:01:41,056 --> 00:01:44,713
Oh, I don't know.
Girl of your dreams, dating a billionaire.

38
00:01:44,809 --> 00:01:47,729
Okay, first of all, hundred millionaire.

39
00:01:47,825 --> 00:01:50,487
And second,
she's not the girl of my dreams.

40
00:01:50,583 --> 00:01:51,771
We're just friends.

41
00:01:51,867 --> 00:01:53,695
Look, it would not be smart
if we got together.

42
00:01:53,792 --> 00:01:56,037
I mean, I'm looking to settle down,
she's looking for...

43
00:01:57,961 --> 00:01:59,884
What, you done? Great.

44
00:02:00,143 --> 00:02:03,184
Check out table number four.

45
00:02:04,057 --> 00:02:07,971
See that little hottie on the end?
She's short, but has an ample bosom.

46
00:02:08,067 --> 00:02:11,275
I love it. She's like half boob. Let's go.

47
00:02:11,371 --> 00:02:14,002
Yeah, and say what?
What's our big opening line?

48
00:02:14,098 --> 00:02:17,171
Oh, it's, 'Daddy's home.'

49
00:02:18,428 --> 00:02:19,711
- Daddy's home?
- Yeah.

50
00:02:19,807 --> 00:02:22,502
Okay, you want us
to go over there, right now,

51
00:02:22,598 --> 00:02:25,164
and say to those girls, Daddy's home?

52
00:02:25,261 --> 00:02:27,876
Really think about that, Barney.

53
00:02:28,757 --> 00:02:31,003
Yeah, I think it's pretty solid.

54
00:02:31,099 --> 00:02:32,608
Okay, think about this.

55
00:02:32,704 --> 00:02:36,521
Is there even a single item on the menu
that has garlic in it?

56
00:02:36,617 --> 00:02:38,414
There's garlic fries.

57
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:41,207
Okay, well, I'll get back to you.

58
00:02:41,236 --> 00:02:43,281
Oh! Daddy's back.

59
00:02:43,386 --> 00:02:45,439
See, if you'd taken
a moment to think about that...

60
00:02:45,535 --> 00:02:50,155
Then Daddy wouldn't have gotten this
seven-digit Father's Day card from Amy.

61
00:02:51,374 --> 00:02:53,453
That worked? I hate the world.

62
00:02:53,454 --> 00:02:56,084
Ted, your problem is
all you do is think, think, think.

63
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:58,137
I'm teaching you how to do, do, do.

64
00:02:58,233 --> 00:03:00,156
- Doo-doo.
- Totally.

65
00:03:00,575 --> 00:03:03,719
So I think a lot.
I happen to have a very powerful brain.

66
00:03:03,815 --> 00:03:07,002
- It can't be helped.
- Oh, yes, it can.

67
00:03:07,215 --> 00:03:08,434
Interesting!

68
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:10,969
Ted, I believe you and I met for a reason.

69
00:03:11,065 --> 00:03:13,631
It's like the universe was saying,
'Hey, Barney, there's this dude,

70
00:03:13,727 --> 00:03:16,871
'he's pretty cool,
but it's your job to make him awesome.'

71
00:03:16,967 --> 00:03:19,117
Your brain screws you up, Ted.
It gets in the way.

72
00:03:19,213 --> 00:03:21,779
It happened with Robin.
It happened with half boob.

73
00:03:21,875 --> 00:03:23,415
And it's gonna keep on happening,

74
00:03:23,511 --> 00:03:27,970
until you power down that bucket
of neuroses, inebriation style.

75
00:03:28,066 --> 00:03:30,505
So what? You want me to do a shot?

76
00:03:30,601 --> 00:03:33,296
Oh, no. I want you to do five shots.

77
00:03:33,392 --> 00:03:35,843
- Oh, more interesting.
- Whoa.

78
00:03:35,926 --> 00:03:40,546
- Barney, I think you've officially...
- No, don't think. Do!

79
00:03:40,642 --> 00:03:45,036
Ted, he's right. You over think.
Maybe you should over drink.

80
00:03:45,133 --> 00:03:47,956
- Drink. Drink. Drink. Drink.
- Drink. Drink. Drink.

81
00:03:48,052 --> 00:03:50,330
Lily, will you tell these guys
how stupid they're being?

82
00:03:50,426 --> 00:03:54,917
Guys, you are being immature,
and moronic, and drink, drink.

83
00:03:55,013 --> 00:03:58,702
- Drink, drink, drink, drink, drink, drink.
- Drink, drink, drink, drink, drink, drink.

84
00:03:58,798 --> 00:03:59,889
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

85
00:03:59,985 --> 00:04:01,750
- Drink, drink, drink...
- Drink, drink, drink...

86
00:04:01,846 --> 00:04:03,868
Let me tell you
something about this brain, okay?

87
00:04:03,964 --> 00:04:05,022
Drink, drink!
...drink, drink!

88
00:04:05,118 --> 00:04:06,081
Yeah!

89
00:04:06,177 --> 00:04:08,582
Mere alcohol cannot stop this brain.

90
00:04:08,679 --> 00:04:10,091
- Drink, drink, drink...
- Drink, drink, drink...

91
00:04:10,187 --> 00:04:11,438
I love it. I love it. I love it!

92
00:04:11,534 --> 00:04:14,357
This brain, dear mortals,
is no ordinary brain.

93
00:04:14,453 --> 00:04:16,122
Drink, drink, drink...
...drink, drink, drink...

94
00:04:16,218 --> 00:04:17,565
This is a super brain.

95
00:04:17,661 --> 00:04:19,682
Drink, drink. Drink!
...drink, drink. Drink!

96
00:04:19,778 --> 00:04:23,047
This brain is unstoppable! This brain...

97
00:04:23,082 --> 00:04:28,639
<i>And that's all I remember,
except for a few hazy memories.</i>

98
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:43,965
<i>And, really, the next thing I remember
is waking up the following morning.</i>

99
00:05:00,909 --> 00:05:03,251
<i>So, there were some
unanswered questions.</i>

100
00:05:03,348 --> 00:05:04,919
<i>How much did I drink?</i>

101
00:05:05,016 --> 00:05:06,972
<i>How did I sprain my ankle?</i>

102
00:05:10,469 --> 00:05:13,084
<i>And who was this girl in my bed?</i>

103
00:05:13,581 --> 00:05:15,504
There's a rock star.

104
00:05:15,532 --> 00:05:18,323
Okay. What the hell happened last night?

105
00:05:18,419 --> 00:05:21,307
You really don't remember, super brain?

106
00:05:21,403 --> 00:05:24,161
<i>So, Uncle Marshall
and Aunt Lily filled me in.</i>

107
00:05:24,257 --> 00:05:28,973
- And how'd you guys like the shots?
- I drank all five, bitch!

108
00:05:29,069 --> 00:05:32,983
- I love drunk Ted.
- Marshall thinks you're a vampire.

109
00:05:35,421 --> 00:05:38,854
If he pukes, one of you guys cleans it up.

110
00:05:39,559 --> 00:05:40,682
No dibs!

111
00:05:40,778 --> 00:05:42,479
No... Oh, damn it!

112
00:05:42,575 --> 00:05:45,879
How quickly you all forget!
I haven't puked since high school.

113
00:05:45,975 --> 00:05:48,100
I am vomit-free since '93.

114
00:05:48,605 --> 00:05:52,543
Vomit-free since '93. That's funny.
I'm funny!

115
00:05:53,033 --> 00:05:54,637
- Who are you calling?
- Robin.

116
00:05:54,733 --> 00:05:56,145
Bad idea jeans.

117
00:05:56,241 --> 00:05:59,032
No, no, it's a great idea.
That's the whole point of getting drunk.

118
00:05:59,128 --> 00:06:01,533
You do things you'd never do
in a million years if you were sober.

119
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:03,715
Says every girl you've ever slept with.

120
00:06:03,811 --> 00:06:05,734
Say what?

121
00:06:07,212 --> 00:06:08,591
Hello, Robin, it's Ted.

122
00:06:08,687 --> 00:06:11,548
- Hi, Ted.
- Hello, Robin, it's Ted.

123
00:06:11,702 --> 00:06:14,430
Hi, Ted. Sounds like you're having fun.

124
00:06:14,526 --> 00:06:19,266
Robin, have I ever told you
that I am vomit-free since '93?

125
00:06:19,434 --> 00:06:22,065
Oh, listen, Ted, I can't really talk right...

126
00:06:22,131 --> 00:06:24,922
Ninety-three? Dude, that's impressive.

127
00:06:25,018 --> 00:06:28,226
Robin, you know, I don't say this enough,
but you're a great woman!

128
00:06:28,322 --> 00:06:31,113
<i>And a great reporter.
You should be on 60 Minutes.</i>

129
00:06:31,209 --> 00:06:33,906
You should be one of the minutes!

130
00:06:34,096 --> 00:06:37,658
Well, that's sweet and odd,
but I'm kind of on a date right now.

131
00:06:37,754 --> 00:06:39,326
Yeah, and I disagree with Barney.

132
00:06:39,422 --> 00:06:41,122
Just 'cause this guy is spending
a lot of money...

133
00:06:41,218 --> 00:06:42,950
doesn't mean you have to put out.

134
00:06:43,046 --> 00:06:46,087
Take it slow, Robin. Take it slow.

135
00:06:46,864 --> 00:06:49,325
- Slow.
- Bye, Ted.

136
00:06:49,375 --> 00:06:51,012
Slow.

137
00:06:51,108 --> 00:06:53,995
Wow, right. That's why we don't do shots.

138
00:06:54,091 --> 00:06:56,336
Friends don't let friends drink and dial.

139
00:06:56,432 --> 00:06:59,577
- I need that phone back!
- You'll get this back at the end of class.

140
00:06:59,673 --> 00:07:03,233
Ding! Class dismissed. Here you go, kid,
you call whoever you want.

141
00:07:03,329 --> 00:07:04,613
Thank you, kind sir!

142
00:07:04,709 --> 00:07:08,591
At least someone appreciates the fact
that I am doing and not thinking.

143
00:07:08,687 --> 00:07:13,018
And now, I don't think
I won't not go to the bathroom.

144
00:07:14,109 --> 00:07:17,412
Was that necessary?
He is not making smart decisions.

145
00:07:17,508 --> 00:07:21,743
Exactly! It's like, what's he gonna do next?
I don't know, but I want to find out!

146
00:07:26,042 --> 00:07:28,864
Cheap Trick. Oh, Ted.

147
00:07:31,752 --> 00:07:33,484
Hello again, Ted.

148
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:49,621
I love everyone in this bar!

149
00:07:49,717 --> 00:07:51,923
And we love you, drunk Ted!

150
00:08:00,591 --> 00:08:02,195
Ted?

151
00:08:02,291 --> 00:08:03,767
Well, that explains the ankle.

152
00:08:03,863 --> 00:08:06,109
And then we brought you home
and put you to bed.

153
00:08:06,205 --> 00:08:09,392
Was there anyone else in there with me?

154
00:08:19,582 --> 00:08:21,539
- There's a girl in there.
- I know.

155
00:08:21,635 --> 00:08:23,559
- And a pineapple.
- I know!

156
00:08:23,656 --> 00:08:25,944
- Who is she?
- I don't know.

157
00:08:28,051 --> 00:08:31,729
- What the hell happened to my jacket?
- Whoa.

158
00:08:31,964 --> 00:08:34,824
That girl in there is alive, right?

159
00:08:35,846 --> 00:08:39,932
I should call Barney.
Maybe he knows what happened.

160
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:57,371
Hello.

161
00:08:57,468 --> 00:08:58,975
Why are you sleeping in our tub?

162
00:08:59,071 --> 00:09:02,585
The porcelain keeps the suit
from wrinkling.

163
00:09:03,017 --> 00:09:04,878
Wait, were you here
when I went to the bathroom...

164
00:09:04,974 --> 00:09:09,081
- in the middle of the night?
- Don't worry, I slept through it.

165
00:09:09,177 --> 00:09:11,775
I totally didn't sleep through it!

166
00:09:11,872 --> 00:09:15,958
Oh, and, wow,
for a little girl you got a big tank.

167
00:09:16,106 --> 00:09:18,768
How did you get in here, anyway?
We put Ted to bed around 1:00.

168
00:09:18,864 --> 00:09:21,270
Oh, you put Ted to bed all right.

169
00:09:21,367 --> 00:09:25,207
You guys take care of me.
You guys are the best.

170
00:09:25,473 --> 00:09:27,434
I love you guys so much.

171
00:09:28,199 --> 00:09:31,550
- Good night, Ted.
- Love you, too, buddy.

172
00:09:32,723 --> 00:09:32,803
I'm back, baby doll!

173
00:09:32,899 --> 00:09:34,830
I'm back, baby doll!

174
00:09:35,353 --> 00:09:38,492
Hey! He rallies!

175
00:09:38,785 --> 00:09:42,378
And the night begins now. All right.
Game face on.

176
00:09:42,474 --> 00:09:45,875
Carl, two more. All right, all right.
What do we think of this one?

177
00:09:45,971 --> 00:09:49,532
- I think she...
- Trick question. No thinking!

178
00:09:49,628 --> 00:09:52,163
You know what time it is? It's do o'clock.

179
00:09:52,259 --> 00:09:54,220
- Let's ride.
- Bring it!

180
00:09:55,306 --> 00:09:56,654
Hi.

181
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:59,955
Have you met Ted? He...

182
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:04,191
Excuse me.

183
00:10:05,957 --> 00:10:08,587
- You're calling Robin.
- I'm calling Robin.

184
00:10:08,684 --> 00:10:13,078
Ted, as your mentor and spiritual guide,
I forbid you from calling her.

185
00:10:13,174 --> 00:10:15,547
Oh, yeah? What you gonna do?

186
00:10:17,569 --> 00:10:21,163
If you complete that call,
I will set your coat on fire.

187
00:10:22,317 --> 00:10:23,825
You're bluffing.

188
00:10:26,295 --> 00:10:27,803
Hello, Robin, it's Ted.

189
00:10:27,899 --> 00:10:30,081
Ted, for the last time, stop...

190
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:32,679
Ted?

191
00:10:32,775 --> 00:10:34,885
You set me on fire.

192
00:10:35,277 --> 00:10:39,993
Real suede wouldn't have gone up so fast.
You got robbed. This is a blend.

193
00:10:40,089 --> 00:10:42,266
You set me on fire!

194
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,570
And who's the girl in my bed?

195
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:57,166
There's a girl in your bed.

196
00:10:57,237 --> 00:11:01,022
And a pineapple! Am I the only one
who's curious about the pineapple?

197
00:11:01,118 --> 00:11:03,570
- Who is she?
- I have no idea.

198
00:11:03,588 --> 00:11:05,193
Nice.

199
00:11:05,289 --> 00:11:06,604
You really don't know who that is?

200
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:08,464
No. After I hosed you down
with the beverage gun,

201
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:09,748
I brought you back here.

202
00:11:09,844 --> 00:11:12,459
I better not have gotten burned.

203
00:11:14,977 --> 00:11:16,837
Did any of you write that?

204
00:11:16,933 --> 00:11:19,957
'Hi, I'm Ted. If lost please call...'

205
00:11:20,622 --> 00:11:24,243
- Whose number is that?
- I don't know.

206
00:11:24,344 --> 00:11:26,267
Dude, call it.

207
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:30,018
Oh, hold on.
I'm gonna make some popcorn.

208
00:11:30,991 --> 00:11:35,485
Okay, you can call now.
God, this is intense. I love it.

209
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:40,738
- <i>Hello.
- Hi. Who is this?</i>

210
00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:44,143
<i>- You called me. Who's this?
- It's Ted.</i>

211
00:11:44,593 --> 00:11:46,516
It's Carl from the bar.

212
00:11:47,063 --> 00:11:48,699
<i>And then Carl filled us in.</i>

213
00:11:48,795 --> 00:11:53,543
Barney, you've always taken care of me.
You are a gentleman and a scholar!

214
00:11:53,639 --> 00:11:56,269
Go into my stable
and take my finest stallion.

215
00:11:56,365 --> 00:11:59,225
He's yours. His name is Windjammer.

216
00:12:00,215 --> 00:12:02,138
Sleep it off, bro.

217
00:12:03,744 --> 00:12:05,667
I'm back, baby doll!

218
00:12:07,786 --> 00:12:11,143
And I am gonna throw up.

219
00:12:13,499 --> 00:12:16,441
I threw up? My streak is over.

220
00:12:16,547 --> 00:12:19,816
Vomit-free since '05 doesn't sound good.

221
00:12:20,011 --> 00:12:21,934
Sorry, Carl, go on.

222
00:12:22,610 --> 00:12:24,150
Carl?

223
00:12:24,246 --> 00:12:28,448
Did you know the word 'karaoke'
is Japanese for empty orchestra?

224
00:12:28,545 --> 00:12:31,160
Isn't that hauntingly beautiful?

225
00:12:31,688 --> 00:12:33,611
Are you a vampire?

226
00:12:34,127 --> 00:12:37,110
All right. I'm cutting you off.
Go home and get some sleep, Ted.

227
00:12:37,206 --> 00:12:39,387
Yeah, sun's gonna come up soon.

228
00:12:39,484 --> 00:12:43,161
Wouldn't want to be around for that,
would we?

229
00:12:43,269 --> 00:12:45,450
Hey, how easy you think it would be
to sneak into the zoo?

230
00:12:45,546 --> 00:12:47,824
I have to see some penguins,
like, right now.

231
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:50,944
- All right, give me your arm.
- Okay.

232
00:12:51,193 --> 00:12:54,272
This way, if you pass out in the gutter...

233
00:12:54,368 --> 00:12:56,165
It tickles!

234
00:12:56,261 --> 00:12:59,629
Someone will call me,
and I will come get you.

235
00:12:59,725 --> 00:13:01,169
Thanks, Carl.

236
00:13:01,265 --> 00:13:03,382
We can't just be friends!
We're attracted to each other.

237
00:13:03,479 --> 00:13:05,930
- We both know it.
- Excuse me?

238
00:13:06,334 --> 00:13:10,729
Me and Robin. Me and Robin.
I have to make one more call.

239
00:13:10,825 --> 00:13:12,748
Yeah, this'll go good.

240
00:13:16,090 --> 00:13:18,013
Hey, it's me again.

241
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:21,961
Look. Who are we kidding?
You and I are both attracted to each other.

242
00:13:22,057 --> 00:13:24,783
We're young. We're drunk.
Half of us, anyway.

243
00:13:24,879 --> 00:13:26,291
And we only get one life.

244
00:13:26,387 --> 00:13:28,665
So, why don't you come over
to my apartment right now,

245
00:13:28,762 --> 00:13:31,392
and we'll think of something stupid
to do together.

246
00:13:31,488 --> 00:13:33,411
Really? Great.

247
00:13:33,509 --> 00:13:35,849
Wait, really? Great.

248
00:13:36,781 --> 00:13:38,704
Thanks, Carl.

249
00:13:39,283 --> 00:13:42,062
It's Robin. That's Robin in there.

250
00:13:43,935 --> 00:13:45,857
Did you guys...

251
00:13:50,575 --> 00:13:52,725
Oh, come on.
You've gotta give me this one.

252
00:13:52,821 --> 00:13:55,675
Those five shots got you farther
with Robin than your brain ever did.

253
00:13:55,772 --> 00:13:58,339
See what happens when you don't think?
You do!

254
00:13:58,435 --> 00:14:02,471
More importantly, you do Robin. Come on!

255
00:14:04,472 --> 00:14:06,678
All right, right over here.

256
00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:10,150
But, still, what does this mean?
Are we dating now?

257
00:14:10,246 --> 00:14:12,010
I mean,
I never pictured it going down this way,

258
00:14:12,107 --> 00:14:14,480
but maybe that's how it had to happen.
I mean, think about it.

259
00:14:14,576 --> 00:14:17,143
Someone get him a shot.
He's thinking again.

260
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:20,801
Well, hold on, man. Maybe it's not
such a bad idea to think about this one.

261
00:14:20,897 --> 00:14:24,586
You and Robin went down this road
before. You got dinged up, really bad.

262
00:14:24,682 --> 00:14:28,018
You know who might have something
to say about Ted's future with Robin?

263
00:14:28,114 --> 00:14:30,224
Robin. Go wake her up.

264
00:14:30,488 --> 00:14:33,920
- Wake her up and say what?
- Daddy's home.

265
00:14:37,802 --> 00:14:39,725
Good luck, buddy.

266
00:14:46,913 --> 00:14:49,037
- Hello?
- Ted, it's Robin.

267
00:14:53,873 --> 00:14:55,796
Are you sure?

268
00:15:01,952 --> 00:15:04,894
Hey, Robin. How are you?

269
00:15:04,999 --> 00:15:06,314
Ted, I think you and I should have a talk...

270
00:15:06,410 --> 00:15:07,983
- Is that Robin?
- So, who's the girl in the bedroom?

271
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:09,908
About those phone calls last night.
- I have no idea!

272
00:15:10,004 --> 00:15:11,833
- Do you mind if I swing by?
- Ask her about the pineapple!

273
00:15:11,929 --> 00:15:13,180
- Yeah, sure. Come on over.
- Thanks.

274
00:15:13,276 --> 00:15:15,199
No! Wait! Don't come.

275
00:15:15,522 --> 00:15:17,125
She's coming over. Crap!

276
00:15:17,222 --> 00:15:21,681
Wait, this is killing me.
We have to find out who that girl is.

277
00:15:21,777 --> 00:15:25,616
Trudy. My name is Trudy.

278
00:15:29,861 --> 00:15:32,075
<i>And then Trudy filled us in.</i>

279
00:15:32,171 --> 00:15:34,160
I'm just surprised
you didn't dump him sooner.

280
00:15:34,256 --> 00:15:37,624
I know. It's two years of my life
I'm never getting back.

281
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:42,789
A little part of me wants to
just jump the bones of the next guy I see.

282
00:15:42,885 --> 00:15:44,808
Daddy's home.

283
00:15:44,970 --> 00:15:46,893
Or the one after that.

284
00:15:47,184 --> 00:15:49,301
Okay, fair enough.
But I've got to prove a point to a friend.

285
00:15:49,397 --> 00:15:54,363
So, you just gave me your number,
and your name is Amy.

286
00:15:55,139 --> 00:15:57,062
Ladies.

287
00:15:57,416 --> 00:15:59,705
I love everyone in this bar!

288
00:16:00,144 --> 00:16:02,067
Look at that idiot go.

289
00:16:02,453 --> 00:16:04,376
He's kind of cute.

290
00:16:11,050 --> 00:16:13,778
What are you doing in the men's room?

291
00:16:13,874 --> 00:16:16,279
What am I doing in the ladies' room?

292
00:16:16,376 --> 00:16:19,359
Oh, right, I came in here
'cause I thought I was gonna throw up.

293
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:21,378
Did you?

294
00:16:22,085 --> 00:16:24,008
I did not.

295
00:16:24,652 --> 00:16:28,412
And the streak continues.
Vomit-free since '93.

296
00:16:30,137 --> 00:16:31,742
Sorry, Trudy. Go on.

297
00:16:31,751 --> 00:16:33,355
I liked your performance.

298
00:16:33,451 --> 00:16:35,374
What, the karaoke?

299
00:16:37,366 --> 00:16:38,778
I wish I had your guts.

300
00:16:38,874 --> 00:16:41,569
Getting up
and making a complete idiot of myself.

301
00:16:41,665 --> 00:16:43,841
- So do it.
- I don't know.

302
00:16:44,584 --> 00:16:47,182
Still, I've had a pretty serious week.

303
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:49,556
I could sure stand to do something stupid.

304
00:16:49,652 --> 00:16:51,940
I'm something stupid. Do me.

305
00:16:52,315 --> 00:16:53,855
You're funny.

306
00:16:53,951 --> 00:16:57,056
- Hey, can I call you sometime?
- Okay.

307
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:59,723
Here, let me.

308
00:17:01,265 --> 00:17:03,254
Why do they call it 'karaoke,' anyhow?

309
00:17:03,351 --> 00:17:06,302
Was it invented by a woman
named Carrie Okie?

310
00:17:06,398 --> 00:17:08,836
These are the kinds of things I think about.

311
00:17:08,932 --> 00:17:12,454
'Karaoke' is Japanese for empty orchestra.

312
00:17:13,102 --> 00:17:16,459
Wow. That's hauntingly beautiful.

313
00:17:19,743 --> 00:17:21,315
Hey, it works.

314
00:17:21,411 --> 00:17:24,843
Then I guess you're gonna have to call me.

315
00:17:25,774 --> 00:17:27,980
I gotta make one more call.

316
00:17:29,206 --> 00:17:30,425
Hello?

317
00:17:30,521 --> 00:17:31,869
Hey, it's me again.

318
00:17:31,965 --> 00:17:32,992
Hey.

319
00:17:33,088 --> 00:17:36,424
Look. Who are we kidding?
You and I are both attracted to each other.

320
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:39,311
We're young. We're drunk.
Half of us, anyway.

321
00:17:39,407 --> 00:17:40,755
And we only get one life.

322
00:17:40,851 --> 00:17:42,831
So I came over here.

323
00:17:43,418 --> 00:17:46,605
And now I'm really, really embarrassed.

324
00:17:47,877 --> 00:17:49,994
Damn it, Trudy!
What about the pineapple?

325
00:17:50,090 --> 00:17:52,013
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

326
00:17:55,897 --> 00:17:59,361
Robin's here. Look,
Trudy, I need you to hide in my bedroom.

327
00:17:59,457 --> 00:18:00,676
Why? Is that your girlfriend?

328
00:18:00,772 --> 00:18:03,371
No. That's not my girlfriend.
Look, it's complicated.

329
00:18:03,467 --> 00:18:05,392
You're married.
Yeah, I can't believe I did this.

330
00:18:05,488 --> 00:18:10,064
No, no, no. I'm not married.
I'll explain after you hide.

331
00:18:15,946 --> 00:18:17,005
- Hello.
- Hi.

332
00:18:17,101 --> 00:18:18,512
- Hey, Robin. Top of the morning.
- Hey, guys.

333
00:18:18,608 --> 00:18:19,779
Hey, Robin. Good sweater.

334
00:18:19,875 --> 00:18:21,495
Hey, Robin. Good sweater.

335
00:18:21,591 --> 00:18:24,704
Sorry I kept calling you like that.
I was pretty drunk.

336
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:28,232
Yeah, no kidding.
Those calls were really weird.

337
00:18:28,328 --> 00:18:30,766
Look, Ted, maybe we need to talk.

338
00:18:30,862 --> 00:18:33,365
- Let's go get a snack.
- I love to snack.

339
00:18:33,461 --> 00:18:35,384
I'm good.

340
00:18:39,267 --> 00:18:41,962
Come on. Those calls weren't that weird.

341
00:18:47,105 --> 00:18:49,230
<i>Robin! Come hang out!</i>

342
00:18:49,319 --> 00:18:52,303
<i>Okay, I'm gonna make this sound
till you come hang out.</i>

343
00:18:57,852 --> 00:19:00,258
That goes on for three and a half minutes.

344
00:19:00,354 --> 00:19:03,563
Without a breath?
That's gotta be some kind of record.

345
00:19:03,659 --> 00:19:06,192
Ted, you can't do this. Please.

346
00:19:06,193 --> 00:19:08,824
We agreed to be friends,
and now you're making it all confusing.

347
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:12,256
No, I'm not. Look,
I just turned off my brain for the night.

348
00:19:12,352 --> 00:19:14,661
Nothing's changed. You've moved on.
I've moved on.

349
00:19:14,757 --> 00:19:16,868
Really? You've moved on?

350
00:19:16,972 --> 00:19:19,695
Yes. What, you don't believe me?

351
00:19:19,794 --> 00:19:21,717
Oh, okay.

352
00:19:22,489 --> 00:19:24,412
Trudy! Come on out.

353
00:19:24,734 --> 00:19:26,114
You are gonna laugh.

354
00:19:26,210 --> 00:19:30,637
- Wait, you were with someone last night?
- Yeah, Trudy. She's cool.

355
00:19:30,733 --> 00:19:32,656
Trudy, come on out.

356
00:19:32,883 --> 00:19:35,089
Yeah, seriously, it's okay.

357
00:19:36,155 --> 00:19:40,868
This is so Trudy. She's really shy. I think.

358
00:19:42,121 --> 00:19:44,044
Trudy?

359
00:19:48,922 --> 00:19:52,518
Hi, Trudy. I'm Robin. It's nice to meet you.

360
00:19:53,221 --> 00:19:54,761
You're right, she's shy.

361
00:19:54,857 --> 00:19:58,385
I'm not making this up.
She must've climbed out the fire escape.

362
00:19:58,482 --> 00:20:01,978
Whatever. Whatever.
I don't care what you think.

363
00:20:02,074 --> 00:20:04,853
Then why did you hide her from me?

364
00:20:05,411 --> 00:20:06,727
Wow, you're good.

365
00:20:06,823 --> 00:20:09,164
<i>Anyone ever tell you
you should be on 60 Minutes?</i>

366
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:12,202
- Yes, you did. Last night.
- Really?

367
00:20:14,681 --> 00:20:15,901
Well.

368
00:20:15,997 --> 00:20:18,885
Get some sleep, Ted. You had a long night.

369
00:20:18,981 --> 00:20:22,577
And don't feel bad.
I've woken up with worse.

370
00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:31,749
<i>I left Trudy a message.
But she never called me back.</i>

371
00:20:31,845 --> 00:20:33,897
<i>That's just how life works sometimes.</i>

372
00:20:33,993 --> 00:20:35,598
<i>You turn off your brain for a night,</i>

373
00:20:35,694 --> 00:20:39,448
<i>and all you're left with the next day
is a bad hangover, a sprained ankle...</i>

374
00:20:39,544 --> 00:20:41,308
<i>and a pineapple.</i>

375
00:20:41,404 --> 00:20:44,323
<i>Oh, and we never found out
where that pineapple came from.</i>

376
00:20:44,419 --> 00:20:46,342
<i>But it was delicious.</i>
