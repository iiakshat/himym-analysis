1
00:00:04,388 --> 00:00:07,588
Kids, I'm gonna tell
you an incredible story ;

2
00:00:07,588 --> 00:00:09,828
the story of how I met your mother.

3
00:00:09,828 --> 00:00:12,148
Are we being punished for something?

4
00:00:12,148 --> 00:00:12,748
No.

5
00:00:12,748 --> 00:00:14,668
Yeah, is this gonna take a while?

6
00:00:14,668 --> 00:00:18,548
Yes. 25 years ago, before I was Dad,

7
00:00:18,548 --> 00:00:20,708
I had this whole other life.

8
00:00:24,388 --> 00:00:26,428
It was way back in 2005.

9
00:00:26,428 --> 00:00:29,228
I was 27, just starting
to make it as an architect

10
00:00:29,228 --> 00:00:32,148
and living in New York with
Marshall, my best friend from college.

11
00:00:32,148 --> 00:00:33,388
My life was good.

12
00:00:33,388 --> 00:00:36,188
And then Uncle Marshall went
and screwed the whole thing up.

13
00:00:38,343 --> 00:00:40,023
Will you marry me?

14
00:00:40,823 --> 00:00:41,863
Yes. Perfect!

15
00:00:41,863 --> 00:00:43,943
And then you're engaged.
You pop the champagne.

16
00:00:43,943 --> 00:00:44,703
You drink a toast.

17
00:00:44,703 --> 00:00:46,543
You have sex on the kitchen floor.

18
00:00:46,543 --> 00:00:48,383
Don't have sex on our kitchen floor.

19
00:00:48,383 --> 00:00:49,063
Got it.

20
00:00:49,063 --> 00:00:50,543
Thanks for helping
me plan this out, Ted.

21
00:00:50,543 --> 00:00:52,903
Dude, are you kidding
? It's you and Lilly.

22
00:00:52,903 --> 00:00:55,383
I've been there for all the
big moments of you and Lilly:

23
00:00:55,383 --> 00:00:59,863
night you met, your first
date, other first things.

24
00:00:59,863 --> 00:01:02,663
Yeah, sorry. We thought you were asleep.

25
00:01:02,663 --> 00:01:03,743
It's physics, Marshall.

26
00:01:03,743 --> 00:01:06,503
If the bottom bunk moves,
the top bunk moves, too.

27
00:01:07,783 --> 00:01:09,063
My God.

28
00:01:09,903 --> 00:01:11,823
You're getting engaged tonight.

29
00:01:12,623 --> 00:01:15,343
Yeah. What are you doin' tonight?

30
00:01:17,337 --> 00:01:18,817
What was I doing?

31
00:01:18,817 --> 00:01:21,377
Here Uncle Marshall was taking
the biggest step of his life.

32
00:01:21,377 --> 00:01:22,257
And me?

33
00:01:22,257 --> 00:01:24,217
I'm calling up your Uncle Barney.

34
00:01:24,377 --> 00:01:27,537
Hey, so you know how I've always
had a thing for half-Asian girls?

35
00:01:28,697 --> 00:01:32,657
Well, now I've got a new
favorite... Lebanese girls.

36
00:01:32,657 --> 00:01:34,857
Lebanese girls are the new half-Asians.

37
00:01:35,457 --> 00:01:36,817
Hey, you want to do somethin' tonight?

38
00:01:36,817 --> 00:01:39,937
Okay, meet me at the bar
in 15 minutes. And suit up!

39
00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:45,730
Where's your suit?

40
00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:48,559
Just once, when I say suit
up, I wish you'd put on a suit.

41
00:01:48,559 --> 00:01:50,319
I did that one time.

42
00:01:50,319 --> 00:01:52,479
It was a blazer!

43
00:01:53,399 --> 00:01:56,759
You know, ever since college it's
been, Marshall and Lilly and me.

44
00:01:56,999 --> 00:01:59,639
Now, it's gonna be Marshall
and Lilly... and me.

45
00:01:59,639 --> 00:02:01,279
They'll get married, start a family.

46
00:02:01,279 --> 00:02:05,919
Before long, I'm that weird, middle-aged
bachelor their kids call Uncle Ted.

47
00:02:07,959 --> 00:02:09,359
I see what this is about.

48
00:02:09,359 --> 00:02:11,679
Have you forgotten what I
said to you the night we met?

49
00:02:14,875 --> 00:02:17,395
Ted, I'm gonna teach you how to live.

50
00:02:18,075 --> 00:02:19,995
Barney. We met at the urinal.

51
00:02:19,995 --> 00:02:21,355
Oh, right. Right.

52
00:02:21,355 --> 00:02:23,355
Lesson one: lose the goatee.

53
00:02:23,355 --> 00:02:24,515
It doesn't go with your suit.

54
00:02:24,515 --> 00:02:27,235
- I'm not wearing a suit.
- Lesson two: get a suit.

55
00:02:27,235 --> 00:02:29,035
Suits are cool. Exhibit "A."

56
00:02:29,715 --> 00:02:34,075
Lesson three: don't even think
about getting married till you're 30.

57
00:02:35,845 --> 00:02:37,565
30. Right. You're right.

58
00:02:37,565 --> 00:02:39,405
I guess it's just, your
best friend gets engaged,

59
00:02:39,405 --> 00:02:40,645
you start thinking about that stuff.

60
00:02:40,645 --> 00:02:42,325
I thought I was your best friend.

61
00:02:42,725 --> 00:02:45,685
Ted, say I'm your best friend.

62
00:02:46,685 --> 00:02:47,685
You're my best friend, Barney.

63
00:02:47,685 --> 00:02:48,565
Good. Then, as your best friend,

64
00:02:48,565 --> 00:02:50,365
I suggest we play a
little game I like to call

65
00:02:50,365 --> 00:02:52,445
- "Have you met Ted?"
- Wait. No, no, no.

66
00:02:52,445 --> 00:02:53,565
We're not playing "Have you met Ted?"

67
00:02:53,565 --> 00:02:54,965
Hi, have you met Ted?

68
00:02:55,685 --> 00:02:58,045
Hi, I'm Ted.

69
00:02:58,045 --> 00:02:58,965
Yasmine.

70
00:02:58,965 --> 00:03:00,245
That's a very pretty name.

71
00:03:00,245 --> 00:03:02,045
Thanks. It's Lebanese.

72
00:03:08,555 --> 00:03:09,915
I'm exhausted.

73
00:03:09,915 --> 00:03:11,555
It was finger-painting day at school,

74
00:03:11,555 --> 00:03:15,275
and a five year-old boy
got to second base with me.

75
00:03:16,595 --> 00:03:18,235
Wow! You're cooking?

76
00:03:18,235 --> 00:03:19,915
Yes, I am.

77
00:03:19,915 --> 00:03:20,995
Aw...

78
00:03:22,275 --> 00:03:23,555
Are you sure that's a good idea?

79
00:03:23,555 --> 00:03:26,675
After last time, you looked
really creepy without eyebrows.

80
00:03:27,235 --> 00:03:28,035
I can handle this.

81
00:03:28,035 --> 00:03:30,315
I think you'll find I'm
full of surprises tonight.

82
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:33,800
So, there's more surprises? Like what?

83
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,840
Marshall was in his
second year of law school,

84
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,240
so he was pretty good
at thinking on his feet.

85
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,520
Boogedyboo!

86
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,280
And that's all of 'em.

87
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,840
I'm gonna go... cook.

88
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:47,280
I'm so happy for Marshall, I really am.

89
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,440
I just couldn't imagine
settling down right now.

90
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,040
So, do you think you'll
ever get married?

91
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,880
Well, maybe eventually...

92
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:56,000
some fall day, possibly in Central Park.

93
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,640
Simple ceremony. We'll
write our own vows.

94
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:00,720
Band, no DJ. People will dance!

95
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,400
I'm not gonna worry about it!

96
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:05,760
Damn it, why did Marshall
have to get engaged?

97
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:09,680
Yeah, nothing hotter than a guy planning
out his own imaginary wedding, huh?

98
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:13,200
- Actually, I think it's cute.
- Well, you're clearly drunk.

99
00:04:15,134 --> 00:04:16,614
One more for the lady!

100
00:04:17,974 --> 00:04:19,254
Oh, hey, look what I got.

101
00:04:23,094 --> 00:04:26,094
Oh, honey! Champagne.

102
00:04:27,294 --> 00:04:28,174
Yeah.

103
00:04:29,574 --> 00:04:33,454
No. You are too old to be scared
to open a bottle of champagne.

104
00:04:33,454 --> 00:04:35,094
- I'm not scared.
- Then open it.

105
00:04:35,094 --> 00:04:36,134
Fine.

106
00:04:38,731 --> 00:04:39,891
Please open it?

107
00:04:40,371 --> 00:04:42,131
You are unbelievable, Marshall.

108
00:04:42,131 --> 00:04:44,651
There are two big questions
a man has to ask in life.

109
00:04:44,651 --> 00:04:46,331
One, you plan out for months.

110
00:04:46,331 --> 00:04:49,211
The other just slips out when
you're half drunk at some bar.

111
00:04:49,211 --> 00:04:50,531
Will you marry me?

112
00:04:50,531 --> 00:04:51,891
You wanna go out sometime?

113
00:04:52,571 --> 00:04:54,491
Of course, you idiot!

114
00:04:55,491 --> 00:04:58,131
I'm sorry, Carl's my boyfriend.

115
00:05:00,963 --> 00:05:02,123
'Sup, Carl?

116
00:05:06,243 --> 00:05:08,283
I promised Ted we wouldn't do that.

117
00:05:09,283 --> 00:05:11,923
Did you know there's a Pop
Tart under your fridge?

118
00:05:11,923 --> 00:05:13,523
No, but dibs.

119
00:05:14,443 --> 00:05:16,043
Where's that champagne?

120
00:05:16,763 --> 00:05:20,083
I wanna drink a toast with my fiancée.

121
00:05:24,031 --> 00:05:25,991
I don't know why I
was so scared of this.

122
00:05:26,391 --> 00:05:27,911
It's pretty easy, right?

123
00:05:30,905 --> 00:05:32,505
Why am I freaking out all of a sudden?

124
00:05:32,538 --> 00:05:34,818
This is crazy. I'm not
ready to settle down.

125
00:05:34,818 --> 00:05:37,258
How does Carl land a Lebanese girl?

126
00:05:37,778 --> 00:05:40,338
The plan has always been don't
even think about it until you're 30.

127
00:05:40,338 --> 00:05:42,498
Exactly. The guy
doesn't even own a suit.

128
00:05:43,058 --> 00:05:44,938
Plus, Marshall's found
the love of his life.

129
00:05:44,938 --> 00:05:47,018
Even if I was ready, which I'm not...

130
00:05:47,018 --> 00:05:51,498
but if I was, it's, like,
"Okay, I'm ready. Where is she?"

131
00:05:55,658 --> 00:05:57,458
And there she was.

132
00:06:04,258 --> 00:06:06,058
It was like something from an old movie,

133
00:06:06,058 --> 00:06:09,298
where the sailor sees the girl
across the crowded dance floor,

134
00:06:09,298 --> 00:06:12,138
turns to his buddy and
says, "See that girl?"

135
00:06:12,138 --> 00:06:14,178
I'm gonna marry her someday."

136
00:06:14,876 --> 00:06:17,356
Hey, Barney, see that girl?

137
00:06:17,357 --> 00:06:20,157
Oh, yeah. You just
know she likes it dirty.

138
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:22,430
Go say hi.

139
00:06:22,431 --> 00:06:23,831
I can't just go say hi.

140
00:06:24,468 --> 00:06:25,668
I need a plan.

141
00:06:25,668 --> 00:06:27,748
I'm gonna wait until
she goes to the bathroom,

142
00:06:27,748 --> 00:06:29,668
then I'll strategically
place myself by the jukebox...

143
00:06:29,668 --> 00:06:31,108
Hi, have you met Ted?

144
00:06:34,988 --> 00:06:37,748
Let me guess... Ted.

145
00:06:40,308 --> 00:06:42,628
Sorry, Lilly. I'm so sorry.

146
00:06:43,404 --> 00:06:45,604
- Take us to the hospital.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

147
00:06:45,604 --> 00:06:46,884
Did you hit her?

148
00:06:48,738 --> 00:06:50,338
Hit me? Please!

149
00:06:50,338 --> 00:06:53,258
This guy can barely even
spank me in bed for fun.

150
00:06:53,258 --> 00:06:55,818
He's all like, "Oh,
honey. Did that hurt?"

151
00:06:55,818 --> 00:06:58,498
And, I'm like, "Come on!
Let me have it, you pansy!"

152
00:06:59,498 --> 00:07:01,978
- Wow, a complete stranger.
- No, no, no, no! It's okay.

153
00:07:01,978 --> 00:07:02,858
Go on.

154
00:07:03,298 --> 00:07:04,938
So, these, uh, spankings...

155
00:07:04,938 --> 00:07:07,818
you in pajamas or Au Naturel?

156
00:07:09,972 --> 00:07:10,852
So, what do you do?

157
00:07:10,852 --> 00:07:12,932
I'm a reporter for Metro News One.

158
00:07:12,932 --> 00:07:15,132
Well, kind of a reporter.

159
00:07:15,132 --> 00:07:17,492
I do those dumb little fluff
pieces at the end of the news.

160
00:07:17,492 --> 00:07:18,932
You know, like, um...

161
00:07:19,492 --> 00:07:21,452
monkey who can play the ukulele.

162
00:07:21,532 --> 00:07:23,532
I'm hoping to get some
bigger stories soon.

163
00:07:23,532 --> 00:07:26,252
Bigger, like, uh... gorilla
with an upright bass?

164
00:07:26,972 --> 00:07:28,572
Sorry. You're really pretty.

165
00:07:33,282 --> 00:07:34,882
Oh, your friends don't seem too happy.

166
00:07:34,882 --> 00:07:37,042
Yeah, see, the one in the middle
just got dumped by her boyfriend.

167
00:07:37,042 --> 00:07:39,562
So, tonight, every guy is "the enemy."

168
00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:41,430
You know if it'll make
your friend feel better,

169
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:43,550
you could throw a drink
in my face. I don't mind.

170
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:45,470
She would love that!

171
00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:47,830
And it does look fun in the movies.

172
00:07:48,470 --> 00:07:50,030
Hey, you wanna have dinner
with me Saturday night?

173
00:07:50,030 --> 00:07:51,230
Oh, I can't.

174
00:07:51,230 --> 00:07:53,270
I'm going to Orlando
for a week on Friday.

175
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:55,630
Some guy's attempting to make
the world's biggest pancake.

176
00:07:55,630 --> 00:07:57,110
Guess who's covering it?

177
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:58,230
That's gonna take a week?

178
00:07:58,230 --> 00:08:00,150
Yeah, he's gonna eat it,
too. It's another record.

179
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:02,630
Hey! What's takin' so long?

180
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:06,190
Uh, I know this is a long shot,
but how 'bout tomorrow night?

181
00:08:08,810 --> 00:08:11,250
Yeah. What the hell?

182
00:08:16,490 --> 00:08:17,530
Jerk!

183
00:08:18,610 --> 00:08:19,730
That was fun.

184
00:08:20,970 --> 00:08:23,730
De... wait for it... nied!

185
00:08:23,730 --> 00:08:25,130
Denied!

186
00:08:25,570 --> 00:08:26,850
We're goin' out tomorrow night.

187
00:08:26,850 --> 00:08:29,250
I thought we were playin'
laser tag tomorrow night.

188
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:31,730
Yeah, I was never
gonna go play laser tag.

189
00:08:36,355 --> 00:08:39,675
The next night, I took her out
to this little bistro in Brooklyn.

190
00:08:41,035 --> 00:08:43,275
That is one badass blue French horn.

191
00:08:43,275 --> 00:08:43,915
Yeah.

192
00:08:44,235 --> 00:08:46,595
Sort of looks like a Smurf penis.

193
00:08:47,595 --> 00:08:49,235
Son, a piece of advice:

194
00:08:49,235 --> 00:08:52,715
when you go on a first date, you
really don't wanna say "Smurf penis".

195
00:08:53,035 --> 00:08:55,155
Girls don't ordinarily like that.

196
00:08:56,515 --> 00:08:59,555
But this was no ordinary girl.

197
00:09:04,418 --> 00:09:05,138
Lilly?

198
00:09:06,698 --> 00:09:08,818
How long have you been sitting there?

199
00:09:08,818 --> 00:09:10,738
Stupid eye patch.

200
00:09:13,058 --> 00:09:17,258
Mom, Dad, I have found
the future Mrs. Ted Mosby.

201
00:09:18,096 --> 00:09:20,416
Marshall, how have I always
described my perfect woman?

202
00:09:20,416 --> 00:09:23,176
Now, let's see... she likes dogs?

203
00:09:23,176 --> 00:09:24,656
I've got five dogs.

204
00:09:24,656 --> 00:09:25,536
She drinks scotch?

205
00:09:25,536 --> 00:09:28,416
I love a scotch that's old
enough to order its own scotch.

206
00:09:28,416 --> 00:09:30,456
Can quote obscure lines
from Ghostbusters?

207
00:09:30,456 --> 00:09:34,176
Ray! When someone asks you if
you're a god, you say "Yes!"

208
00:09:35,296 --> 00:09:37,456
And I'm saving the best for last.

209
00:09:37,456 --> 00:09:39,896
Do you want these? I hate olives.

210
00:09:39,896 --> 00:09:41,856
She hates olives! Awesome!

211
00:09:42,490 --> 00:09:44,250
The olive theory.

212
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:47,050
The olive theory is based on
my friends Marshall and Lilly.

213
00:09:47,050 --> 00:09:48,730
He hates olives, she loves them.

214
00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:50,610
In a weird way, that's what
makes them such a great couple.

215
00:09:50,610 --> 00:09:52,090
Perfect balance.

216
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:56,970
You know, I've had a jar of olives
just sitting in my fridge forever.

217
00:09:58,570 --> 00:10:00,090
I could take 'em off your hands.

218
00:10:01,490 --> 00:10:02,850
They're all yours.

219
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:04,930
Oh, it is on!

220
00:10:06,097 --> 00:10:08,777
It is on till the break of dawn.

221
00:10:10,377 --> 00:10:11,177
But wait.

222
00:10:11,177 --> 00:10:13,737
It's only the break of
10:30. What happened?

223
00:10:14,657 --> 00:10:17,777
I gotta get one of those blue
French horns for over my fireplace.

224
00:10:17,777 --> 00:10:19,537
It's gotta be blue.
It's gotta be French.

225
00:10:19,537 --> 00:10:20,817
- No green clarinet?
- Nope.

226
00:10:20,817 --> 00:10:22,337
Come on. No purple tuba?

227
00:10:22,337 --> 00:10:24,417
It's a Smurf penis or no dice.

228
00:10:26,382 --> 00:10:27,302
There you are!

229
00:10:27,302 --> 00:10:28,382
We got a jumper.

230
00:10:28,382 --> 00:10:30,302
Some crazy guy on the Manhattan Bridge.

231
00:10:30,722 --> 00:10:32,282
Come on. You're coverin' it!

232
00:10:32,802 --> 00:10:35,082
Um... all right. I'll be right there.

233
00:10:36,202 --> 00:10:37,402
I'm sorry.

234
00:10:38,242 --> 00:10:40,282
I had a really great time tonight.

235
00:10:41,322 --> 00:10:42,362
Yeah.

236
00:10:42,362 --> 00:10:44,362
So?! Did you kiss her?

237
00:10:44,682 --> 00:10:46,522
No. The moment wasn't right.

238
00:10:46,522 --> 00:10:48,762
Look, this woman could
actually be my future wife.

239
00:10:48,762 --> 00:10:50,282
I want our first kiss to be amazing.

240
00:10:50,282 --> 00:10:53,002
Aw, Ted, that is so sweet.

241
00:10:53,362 --> 00:10:55,442
So you chickened out
like a little bitch.

242
00:10:57,983 --> 00:11:00,023
What? I did not chicken out.

243
00:11:00,023 --> 00:11:00,663
You know what?

244
00:11:00,663 --> 00:11:03,303
I don't need to take first
kiss advice from some pirate

245
00:11:03,303 --> 00:11:05,343
who hasn't been single since
the first week of college.

246
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:07,943
Anyone who's single would
tell you the same thing,

247
00:11:07,943 --> 00:11:10,423
even the dumbest single person alive.

248
00:11:10,423 --> 00:11:12,863
And if you don't believe me, call him.

249
00:11:15,343 --> 00:11:16,103
Hey, loser.

250
00:11:16,103 --> 00:11:17,263
How's not playing laser tag?

251
00:11:17,263 --> 00:11:19,543
Because playing laser tag is awesome!

252
00:11:20,063 --> 00:11:22,303
- Oh, I killed you, Conner!
- Don't make me get your mom!

253
00:11:22,303 --> 00:11:24,383
Hey, listen. I need your
opinion on something.

254
00:11:24,383 --> 00:11:25,943
Okay, meet me at the bar in 15 minutes.

255
00:11:25,943 --> 00:11:27,023
And suit up!

256
00:11:28,303 --> 00:11:30,383
So, these guys think I chickened out.

257
00:11:30,383 --> 00:11:31,463
What do you think?

258
00:11:31,463 --> 00:11:35,263
I can't believe you're
still not wearing a suit.

259
00:11:37,192 --> 00:11:38,472
She didn't even give me the signal.

260
00:11:38,472 --> 00:11:41,352
What, is she gonna, she gonna
bat her eyes at you in Morse code?

261
00:11:41,352 --> 00:11:46,352
"Ted... kiss me." No
! You just kiss her!

262
00:11:46,352 --> 00:11:48,352
Not if you don't get the signal.

263
00:11:51,352 --> 00:11:52,952
Did Marshall give me the signal?

264
00:11:52,952 --> 00:11:55,352
No! I didn't. I swear.

265
00:11:58,270 --> 00:11:59,350
But, see, at least tonight,

266
00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:00,910
I get to sleep knowing Marshall and me,

267
00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:01,710
never gonna happen.

268
00:12:01,710 --> 00:12:02,950
You should have kissed her.

269
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:04,990
Oh, I should have kissed her.

270
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:07,110
Well, maybe in a week when
she gets back from Orlando.

271
00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:09,390
A week? That's like a
year in hot girl time.

272
00:12:09,390 --> 00:12:10,590
She'll forget all about you.

273
00:12:10,590 --> 00:12:13,910
Mark my words... you will
never see that one again.

274
00:12:14,390 --> 00:12:15,510
There she is.

275
00:12:15,510 --> 00:12:18,590
Ooh! She's cute. Hey, Carl, turn it up.

276
00:12:20,025 --> 00:12:21,985
...persuaded him to reconsider.

277
00:12:22,043 --> 00:12:24,083
At which point, the man
came down off the ledge,

278
00:12:24,083 --> 00:12:27,003
giving this bizarre
story a happy ending.

279
00:12:27,003 --> 00:12:29,443
- Reporting from Metro One News...
- Guy didn't jump.

280
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:32,403
I'm gonna go kiss her.

281
00:12:32,763 --> 00:12:33,523
Right now.

282
00:12:33,523 --> 00:12:34,923
Look, dude. It's midnight.

283
00:12:34,923 --> 00:12:38,683
As your future lawyer, I'm gonna
advise you that's freakin' crazy.

284
00:12:38,683 --> 00:12:40,163
I never do anything crazy.

285
00:12:40,163 --> 00:12:42,683
I'm always waiting for the
moment, planning the moment.

286
00:12:43,083 --> 00:12:44,083
Well, she's leaving tomorrow.

287
00:12:44,083 --> 00:12:45,563
This may be the only
moment I'm gonna get.

288
00:12:46,163 --> 00:12:47,403
I gotta do what that guy couldn't.

289
00:12:47,403 --> 00:12:49,123
I gotta take the leap!

290
00:12:50,083 --> 00:12:51,323
Okay, not a perfect metaphor,

291
00:12:51,323 --> 00:12:52,803
'cause for me it's fall
in love and get married,

292
00:12:52,803 --> 00:12:54,843
and for him it's... death.

293
00:12:55,763 --> 00:12:57,483
Actually, that is a perfect metaphor.

294
00:12:58,043 --> 00:13:00,163
By the way, did I congratulate you two?

295
00:13:01,763 --> 00:13:03,203
I'm doing this.

296
00:13:04,981 --> 00:13:05,901
Let's go.

297
00:13:05,901 --> 00:13:07,661
- Word up.
- We're coming with you.

298
00:13:08,581 --> 00:13:09,461
Barney?

299
00:13:10,861 --> 00:13:13,061
All right, but under one condition.

300
00:13:14,541 --> 00:13:17,101
Look at you, you beautiful
bastard. You suited up!

301
00:13:17,101 --> 00:13:18,861
This is totally going in my blog!

302
00:13:20,141 --> 00:13:20,821
Stop the car.

303
00:13:20,821 --> 00:13:22,261
Uh, pull over right here.

304
00:13:23,741 --> 00:13:25,061
I gotta do something.

305
00:13:25,901 --> 00:13:27,901
Excuse me. Pardon me. Just a sec'.

306
00:13:28,341 --> 00:13:29,501
Enjoy your coffee.

307
00:13:31,701 --> 00:13:33,061
Go! Go! Go!

308
00:13:35,821 --> 00:13:37,661
Everybody brings flowers.

309
00:13:47,882 --> 00:13:48,922
Okay.

310
00:13:48,922 --> 00:13:50,122
Moment of truth.

311
00:13:51,042 --> 00:13:52,082
Wish me luck.

312
00:13:52,082 --> 00:13:54,882
Ted's gonna get it
on with a TV reporter.

313
00:13:54,882 --> 00:13:57,322
"This just in." Okay.

314
00:14:00,935 --> 00:14:02,815
Kiss her, Ted! Kiss her good!

315
00:14:02,815 --> 00:14:04,175
Kiss the crap outta that girl!

316
00:14:04,175 --> 00:14:06,335
Marshall, remember this night.

317
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:08,495
When you're the best man at our
wedding and you give a speech,

318
00:14:08,495 --> 00:14:10,615
you're gonna tell this story.

319
00:14:12,255 --> 00:14:13,935
Why does he get to be the best man?

320
00:14:13,935 --> 00:14:16,015
I'm your best friend!

321
00:14:16,935 --> 00:14:20,415
As I walked up to that door, a
million thoughts raced through my mind.

322
00:14:20,415 --> 00:14:22,895
Unfortunately, one
particular thought did not.

323
00:14:23,814 --> 00:14:25,574
I've got five dogs.

324
00:14:27,614 --> 00:14:29,014
Not good. Not good.

325
00:14:29,014 --> 00:14:30,694
- No!
- Get back in there!

326
00:14:30,694 --> 00:14:32,334
You're wearing a suit!

327
00:14:36,313 --> 00:14:37,593
Ted?

328
00:14:38,553 --> 00:14:39,433
Hi.

329
00:14:41,953 --> 00:14:43,353
I was just, uh...

330
00:14:47,393 --> 00:14:48,633
Come on up.

331
00:14:50,953 --> 00:14:51,753
He's in.

332
00:14:53,742 --> 00:14:54,702
So...

333
00:14:54,702 --> 00:14:57,902
Ranjit, you must have done
it with a Lebanese girl?

334
00:14:57,902 --> 00:15:00,142
Okay, that's my Barney limit.

335
00:15:00,142 --> 00:15:02,662
I'm gonna see if that
bodega has a bathroom.

336
00:15:03,382 --> 00:15:06,262
Actually, I'm from Bangladesh.

337
00:15:06,262 --> 00:15:07,782
The women hot there?

338
00:15:07,782 --> 00:15:10,102
Here's a picture of my wife.

339
00:15:12,062 --> 00:15:14,022
A simple "no" would have sufficed.

340
00:15:15,222 --> 00:15:16,622
She's lovely.

341
00:15:18,619 --> 00:15:23,299
So, Ted, what brings you back to Brooklyn
at 1:00 in the morning in a suit?

342
00:15:24,870 --> 00:15:26,750
I was just hoping to...

343
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:28,910
get those olives...

344
00:15:29,350 --> 00:15:30,750
that you said I could have.

345
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:33,790
Would you like those olives
with some gin and vermouth?

346
00:15:34,310 --> 00:15:36,310
Are you trying to get me drunk?

347
00:15:40,864 --> 00:15:42,144
For starters.

348
00:15:49,464 --> 00:15:52,904
So, Marshall, this olive
theory, based on you and Lilly?

349
00:15:52,904 --> 00:15:54,464
You hate olives.

350
00:15:54,464 --> 00:15:56,424
Lilly loves 'em. You can't stand 'em.

351
00:15:56,424 --> 00:15:57,784
Yeah. Hate olives.

352
00:15:57,784 --> 00:16:02,424
Two weeks ago, Spanish bar on 79th street,
dish of olives, you had some... what up?

353
00:16:06,675 --> 00:16:09,675
You have to swear that this
does not leave this cab.

354
00:16:09,675 --> 00:16:11,675
- I swear.
- I swear.

355
00:16:14,047 --> 00:16:16,527
On our first date, I
ordered a Greek salad.

356
00:16:16,527 --> 00:16:18,447
Lilly asked if she could have my olives.

357
00:16:18,447 --> 00:16:22,767
- I said, "Sure. I hate olives."
- But, you like olives.

358
00:16:22,767 --> 00:16:25,247
Well, I was 18, okay? I was a virgin.

359
00:16:25,247 --> 00:16:28,447
Been waitin' my whole life for
a pretty girl to want my olives.

360
00:16:29,567 --> 00:16:32,047
Marshall, I'm gonna give
you an early wedding present.

361
00:16:32,607 --> 00:16:34,167
Don't get married.

362
00:16:42,527 --> 00:16:44,447
I think I like your olive theory.

363
00:16:45,007 --> 00:16:47,087
I think I like your new French horn.

364
00:16:49,551 --> 00:16:51,351
I think I like your nose.

365
00:16:52,591 --> 00:16:54,511
I think I'm in love with you.

366
00:16:54,511 --> 00:16:57,231
- What?!
- What?!
- What?!

367
00:16:57,951 --> 00:16:59,671
Come on, man, you said your
stomach's been hurting, right?

368
00:16:59,671 --> 00:17:00,991
You know what that is.

369
00:17:00,991 --> 00:17:01,711
Hunger.

370
00:17:01,711 --> 00:17:03,551
You're hungry for experience.

371
00:17:03,551 --> 00:17:05,071
Hungry for something new.

372
00:17:05,071 --> 00:17:07,151
Hungry for olives.

373
00:17:08,586 --> 00:17:11,266
But you're too scared
to do anything about it.

374
00:17:11,266 --> 00:17:13,146
Yeah, I'm scared, okay?

375
00:17:14,666 --> 00:17:17,026
But, when I think of spending
the rest of my life with Lilly...

376
00:17:17,626 --> 00:17:20,506
committing, forever, no other women...

377
00:17:21,106 --> 00:17:22,946
doesn't scare me at all.

378
00:17:23,666 --> 00:17:25,666
I'm marrying that girl.

379
00:17:27,066 --> 00:17:28,226
Lilly.

380
00:17:29,146 --> 00:17:30,866
Lilly, I like olives.

381
00:17:32,604 --> 00:17:34,324
We'll make it work.

382
00:17:46,084 --> 00:17:48,364
So, Orlando. You gonna hit DisneyWorld?

383
00:17:50,462 --> 00:17:52,102
You love me?!

384
00:17:52,782 --> 00:17:54,462
I-I-I can't
believe I said that.

385
00:17:54,462 --> 00:17:56,942
Why did I say that? Who says that?

386
00:17:57,971 --> 00:17:59,331
I should just go.

387
00:17:59,331 --> 00:18:00,491
Hold on.

388
00:18:00,491 --> 00:18:01,891
Wait a minute.

389
00:18:04,411 --> 00:18:05,651
Promised you these.

390
00:18:05,651 --> 00:18:08,611
Olives. Thanks. I love you.

391
00:18:08,611 --> 00:18:10,611
What is wrong with me?

392
00:18:12,371 --> 00:18:13,491
Why are we still sitting here?

393
00:18:13,491 --> 00:18:15,131
Let's go. We can still make last call.

394
00:18:15,131 --> 00:18:16,011
What do you say, Lil?

395
00:18:16,011 --> 00:18:18,531
Yo-ho-ho and a
bottle of rum?

396
00:18:21,907 --> 00:18:23,107
'Cause you're a pirate.

397
00:18:23,507 --> 00:18:25,387
Okay, eye patch, gone.

398
00:18:25,867 --> 00:18:28,107
And we can't just abandon Ted.

399
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:30,827
If it doesn't go well up there,
he's gonna need some support.

400
00:18:30,827 --> 00:18:32,667
It's been, like, 20 minutes.

401
00:18:32,667 --> 00:18:33,947
You think they're doin' it?

402
00:18:33,947 --> 00:18:35,347
You think they're doin'
it in front of the dogs?

403
00:18:35,347 --> 00:18:36,627
Doggy style.

404
00:18:36,987 --> 00:18:38,987
Hey, there was a girl in college,
she had this golden retriever...

405
00:18:38,987 --> 00:18:41,427
Okay, we can go to the
bar. Just stop talking.

406
00:18:41,427 --> 00:18:42,627
Hit it, Ranjit.

407
00:18:48,895 --> 00:18:50,695
So, when you tell this
story to your friends,

408
00:18:50,695 --> 00:18:52,735
could you avoid the word "psycho?"

409
00:18:53,135 --> 00:18:55,695
I'd prefer. "eccentric."

410
00:18:55,895 --> 00:18:58,215
Good night... psycho.

411
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:04,080
Great.

412
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:05,800
Um, how do I get to the F train?

413
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:10,120
Oh, um, two blocks that
way and take a right.

414
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:14,600
You know what?

415
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:17,600
I'm done being single.

416
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:19,440
I'm not good at it.

417
00:19:20,167 --> 00:19:23,847
Look, obviously, you can't tell
a woman you just met you love her.

418
00:19:23,847 --> 00:19:26,647
But... it sucks that you can't.

419
00:19:27,967 --> 00:19:28,847
I'll tell you something, though.

420
00:19:28,847 --> 00:19:32,607
If a woman... not you, just
some hypothetical woman...

421
00:19:32,607 --> 00:19:34,407
were to bear with me through all this,

422
00:19:35,367 --> 00:19:36,927
I think I'd make a damn good husband.

423
00:19:36,927 --> 00:19:38,767
Because, that's the
stuff I'd be good at,

424
00:19:38,767 --> 00:19:42,207
stuff like making her laugh
and being a good father.

425
00:19:44,076 --> 00:19:46,236
And walking her five hypothetical dogs.

426
00:19:47,916 --> 00:19:49,236
Being a good kisser.

427
00:19:51,165 --> 00:19:52,845
Everyone thinks they're a good kisser.

428
00:19:52,845 --> 00:19:54,405
Oh, I've got references.

429
00:19:55,605 --> 00:19:56,685
Good night, Ted.

430
00:20:02,925 --> 00:20:05,165
And I'm a good handshaker.

431
00:20:05,907 --> 00:20:08,387
That's a pretty great handshake.

432
00:20:11,787 --> 00:20:12,907
And that was it.

433
00:20:12,907 --> 00:20:14,747
I'll probably never see her again.

434
00:20:17,897 --> 00:20:18,857
What?

435
00:20:18,857 --> 00:20:20,057
That was the signal.

436
00:20:20,057 --> 00:20:23,777
That long, lingering handshake?
You should have kissed her.

437
00:20:24,017 --> 00:20:26,017
There's no such thing as "the signal."

438
00:20:26,377 --> 00:20:28,217
But, yeah, that was the signal.

439
00:20:28,977 --> 00:20:30,177
Signal.

440
00:20:31,471 --> 00:20:32,991
Ah, Carl, thank you.

441
00:20:32,991 --> 00:20:34,871
Something I gotta do.

442
00:20:35,791 --> 00:20:38,271
By the way, you should have kissed her.

443
00:20:38,591 --> 00:20:40,671
Carl! You guys weren't there.

444
00:20:42,311 --> 00:20:45,031
I am so turned on right now.

445
00:20:45,391 --> 00:20:46,631
Guys, trust me.

446
00:20:46,631 --> 00:20:48,071
I've seen the signal.

447
00:20:48,071 --> 00:20:49,671
That was not the signal.

448
00:20:49,671 --> 00:20:51,591
Yeah, Ted, we're not on you anymore.

449
00:20:52,791 --> 00:20:55,991
- To my fiancée.
- To the future.

450
00:20:56,847 --> 00:20:58,687
To one hell of a night!

451
00:21:01,767 --> 00:21:04,367
That was not the signal.

452
00:21:05,087 --> 00:21:06,687
I asked her about it years later.

453
00:21:07,413 --> 00:21:09,493
And, yeah, that was the signal.

454
00:21:09,493 --> 00:21:10,973
I could have kissed her.

455
00:21:10,973 --> 00:21:12,853
But that's the funny
thing about destiny.

456
00:21:12,853 --> 00:21:14,893
It happens whether you plan it or not.

457
00:21:14,893 --> 00:21:16,813
I mean, I never thought
I'd see that girl again,

458
00:21:16,813 --> 00:21:19,533
but it turns out I was
just too close to the puzzle

459
00:21:19,533 --> 00:21:21,293
to see the picture that was forming.

460
00:21:21,293 --> 00:21:25,653
Because, that, kids, is the true
story of how I met your Aunt Robin.

461
00:21:27,488 --> 00:21:28,768
Aunt Robin?

462
00:21:28,768 --> 00:21:30,768
I thought this was how you met mom!

463
00:21:30,768 --> 00:21:32,848
Will you relax? I'm getting to it.

464
00:21:33,168 --> 00:21:36,888
Like I said, it's a long story.

465
00:21:38,268 --> 00:21:43,268
