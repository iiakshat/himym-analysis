<i>Kids, life is a dark road.
You never really know what's up ahead.</i>

3
00:00:17,834 --> 00:00:20,420
<i>One night, you're cruising along,
enjoying the ride,</i>

4
00:00:20,515 --> 00:00:23,890
<i>and then all of a sudden, you're 28.</i>

5
00:00:23,995 --> 00:00:27,061
- And for the birthday boy, lasagna.
- Thank you.

6
00:00:27,157 --> 00:00:30,410
- Careful. The plate is very hot.
- Okay.

7
00:00:31,339 --> 00:00:33,252
Oh, go on, touch it.

8
00:00:34,372 --> 00:00:36,893
Sweet damn, that's a hot plate!

9
00:00:37,245 --> 00:00:39,512
All right, so, Barney,
are you doing this or what?

10
00:00:39,608 --> 00:00:42,896
- Oh, jeez, Barney, don't do this.
- I have to. It's my birthday present to Ted.

11
00:00:42,992 --> 00:00:45,290
You don't have to.
Please, it's going to be embarrassing,

12
00:00:45,386 --> 00:00:47,557
and we're gonna have
to stop coming here, which will suck,

13
00:00:47,653 --> 00:00:50,335
in addition to probably being
kind of healthy.

14
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:54,357
Come on, Marshall,
it's the greatest pickup line of all time.

15
00:00:54,453 --> 00:00:55,794
Barney.

16
00:00:58,826 --> 00:01:00,455
Ah! Happy birthday, Ted.

17
00:01:03,552 --> 00:01:05,532
Excuse me, has anyone ever told you...

18
00:01:05,627 --> 00:01:07,541
- Oh, my God!
- What?

19
00:01:08,021 --> 00:01:09,650
Oh, call an ambulance!

20
00:01:09,746 --> 00:01:12,044
- What's going on?
- Try not to speak. Here, sit down.

21
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:13,417
Just don't talk. Don't talk.

22
00:01:13,513 --> 00:01:15,908
- Is she okay?
- I'm serious, call 911.

23
00:01:16,003 --> 00:01:16,993
What's wrong? What's the matter?

24
00:01:18,206 --> 00:01:19,643
Just don't move. Don't move. Just try...

25
00:01:19,739 --> 00:01:22,097
Here, have some water. Water!

26
00:01:22,708 --> 00:01:24,621
Here, drink this.

27
00:01:26,028 --> 00:01:28,486
You know, the more I watch this,
the less convinced I am...

28
00:01:28,582 --> 00:01:30,753
that it's the greatest pickup line of all time.

29
00:01:30,848 --> 00:01:32,762
Wait for it.

30
00:01:32,764 --> 00:01:36,595
Twenty-eight.
Two more until the big one. Three-O.

31
00:01:36,691 --> 00:01:39,373
<i>Actually,
my 30th birthday wasn't so bad.</i>

32
00:01:39,468 --> 00:01:41,576
<i>Well, except for the goat in my bathroom.
Which is a great story.</i>

33
00:01:42,789 --> 00:01:44,257
<i>But I'll get to that later.</i>

34
00:01:44,353 --> 00:01:48,121
Still, you know, another year older.
Still single.

35
00:01:48,217 --> 00:01:50,706
You don't hear
your Ted-o-logical clock ticking?

36
00:01:50,802 --> 00:01:53,242
Nope. I hit the snooze button.

37
00:01:53,739 --> 00:01:55,559
And here come the paramedics.

38
00:01:55,655 --> 00:01:58,273
- Oh, thank God, you're here.
- What is going on?

39
00:01:58,369 --> 00:01:59,933
I think there might be
some internal bleeding.

40
00:02:00,029 --> 00:02:02,232
Probably some fractures.
We gotta get her to the hospital.

41
00:02:02,328 --> 00:02:04,690
- What are you talking about?
- You've had a terrible fall.

42
00:02:04,786 --> 00:02:05,775
No, I haven't.

43
00:02:05,871 --> 00:02:11,320
Really? 'Cause I could swear
you fell straight out of heaven, Angel.

44
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:15,001
Give him your number. What?

45
00:02:15,098 --> 00:02:17,329
Give him your number. What?

46
00:02:17,428 --> 00:02:19,887
Give him your...
Come on, guys, you're embarrassing me.

47
00:02:19,983 --> 00:02:21,324
- Give him your number.
- Give him your number.

48
00:02:21,419 --> 00:02:22,633
What are you... Come on.

49
00:02:22,728 --> 00:02:23,973
- Give him your number.
- Give him your number.

50
00:02:24,069 --> 00:02:26,336
They're not going to stop
till you give me your number.

51
00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:27,773
- Give him your number.
- Give him your number.

52
00:02:27,868 --> 00:02:28,922
- All right!
- It works!

53
00:02:31,572 --> 00:02:34,892
I cannot believe
that she gave him her number.

54
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:38,277
Maybe she really does have a brain injury.

55
00:02:38,372 --> 00:02:40,384
Thank you, everyone.
Thank you, everyone. It's been fun.

56
00:02:40,479 --> 00:02:42,842
It's Wendy the waitress. Tip her well.
Thanks a lot, guys.

57
00:02:42,937 --> 00:02:44,790
<i>Troilus and Cressida.
Neighborhood Playhouse.</i>

58
00:02:44,885 --> 00:02:48,077
Check them out, they're good.
They're good.

59
00:02:48,173 --> 00:02:51,462
I realize why I'm still single. I'm picky.
I'm not going to settle.

60
00:02:51,557 --> 00:02:53,505
If I'm going to marry someone,
she has to be perfect.

61
00:02:53,601 --> 00:02:55,804
- Well, what's perfect?
- Well, it's not like I have a list.

62
00:02:55,899 --> 00:02:58,102
- Oh, yes, you do.
- Attractive, college-educated.

63
00:02:58,198 --> 00:02:59,635
She wants two kids, a boy and a girl.

64
00:02:59,731 --> 00:03:01,486
- That's not hard. I know at least...
- I'm not done.

65
00:03:01,582 --> 00:03:04,488
She likes dogs, Otis Redding,
does the crossword.

66
00:03:04,584 --> 00:03:05,541
She's into sports,

67
00:03:05,637 --> 00:03:07,935
but not so much so that her legs
are, like, more muscular than mine.

68
00:03:08,031 --> 00:03:09,021
That weirds me out.

69
00:03:09,117 --> 00:03:11,128
And she plays bass guitar
like Kim Deal from the Pixies.

70
00:03:11,224 --> 00:03:14,640
- Or Kim Gordon from Sonic Youth.
- Any Kim from any cool band, really.

71
00:03:14,735 --> 00:03:17,577
- Can't be too picky.
- You're never going to find this girl.

72
00:03:17,673 --> 00:03:20,228
Exactly. So I'm just going to wait
for her to come to me.

73
00:03:20,323 --> 00:03:22,590
I am done trying to plan the unplannable.

74
00:03:22,686 --> 00:03:25,622
So, what, you think fate's just going
to take care of it?

75
00:03:25,718 --> 00:03:27,631
That's the plan.

76
00:03:28,943 --> 00:03:31,593
<i>And little did I know,
at that very moment, fate,</i>

77
00:03:31,688 --> 00:03:35,552
<i>in the form of a 600-gigahertz,
super-processing computer...</i>

78
00:03:35,648 --> 00:03:37,561
<i>was taking care of it.</i>

79
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:45,984
- Whoa, you're up early.
- Yeah, thought I'd whip up some pancakes.

80
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:49,902
- Does Marshall know?
- He's still sound asleep.

81
00:03:54,731 --> 00:03:57,855
Awesome! So awesome!

82
00:03:58,307 --> 00:04:00,221
God! Best girl ever.

83
00:04:00,414 --> 00:04:03,926
Screw these pancakes, I should cover you
in syrup and gobble you up.

84
00:04:04,022 --> 00:04:06,137
Please don't do that.

85
00:04:06,927 --> 00:04:09,123
Hey, is this milk any good?

86
00:04:11,812 --> 00:04:13,919
Oh, yeah, that totally got me yesterday.

87
00:04:14,015 --> 00:04:16,780
God, why didn't you throw it away?

88
00:04:17,016 --> 00:04:20,209
I'm going shopping after work.
I'll pick up some milk.

89
00:04:20,304 --> 00:04:23,559
Oh! These pancakes are delightful.

90
00:04:26,562 --> 00:04:28,476
What's wrong, baby?

91
00:04:29,403 --> 00:04:31,255
This is the high point of my day.

92
00:04:31,351 --> 00:04:32,309
<i>It was true.</i>

93
00:04:32,404 --> 00:04:34,511
<i>See, Marshall had always dreamed
of using his law degree...</i>

94
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:35,916
<i>to protect the environment.</i>

95
00:04:36,012 --> 00:04:37,385
<i>But he needed money for the wedding,</i>

96
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:40,035
<i>so he'd been interning for two months
at Barney's firm,</i>

97
00:04:40,131 --> 00:04:42,269
<i>and he hated every minute of it.</i>

98
00:04:42,365 --> 00:04:45,558
Hey, Barney, I had some questions
about filling out these requisition forms.

99
00:04:45,653 --> 00:04:47,793
Binoculars. Second pair, on my desk.

100
00:04:47,889 --> 00:04:50,858
I don't have time to be creepy, dude.
I have a lot of work to do.

101
00:04:50,953 --> 00:04:53,149
Just take a look, will you?

102
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:57,607
Hey, corner office. Top floor.

103
00:04:58,233 --> 00:05:00,020
Check out that guy.

104
00:05:00,116 --> 00:05:01,680
Name's Clark Butterfield.

105
00:05:01,776 --> 00:05:03,979
He works over
at Nicholson, Hewitt and West,

106
00:05:04,075 --> 00:05:07,236
and every morning, he orders a sandwich
from the deli downstairs.

107
00:05:07,331 --> 00:05:10,991
- So?
- So, guess what I did to that sandwich?

108
00:05:11,258 --> 00:05:13,172
Here, I took a picture.

109
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:17,674
Oh! Sweet Lord!

110
00:05:18,122 --> 00:05:21,538
And now I'm e-mailing said picture to him.

111
00:05:32,776 --> 00:05:34,085
Duck!

112
00:05:34,181 --> 00:05:36,094
That is sick!

113
00:05:38,587 --> 00:05:40,471
- Why would you do that?
- Who knows?

114
00:05:40,566 --> 00:05:43,280
This feud goes so far back
I can't remember who fired the first shot.

115
00:05:43,376 --> 00:05:45,289
- You?
- Totally.

116
00:05:46,313 --> 00:05:49,569
Well, look, if you would just
help me fill out these forms,

117
00:05:49,665 --> 00:05:51,579
that would be great.

118
00:05:51,772 --> 00:05:52,731
What?

119
00:05:52,826 --> 00:05:55,189
Butterfield is going to retaliate
within the next four hours.

120
00:05:55,284 --> 00:05:57,966
That's been his pattern.
This is war, Eriksen.

121
00:05:58,062 --> 00:06:01,031
I need you to clear your schedule. Call Lily.
Tell her you'll be home late.

122
00:06:01,127 --> 00:06:03,040
This is stupid.

123
00:06:03,042 --> 00:06:06,394
Come on, man, I didn't recruit you
to work here for your lawyering skills.

124
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:10,385
I recruited you to be
my executive mischief consultant.

125
00:06:10,481 --> 00:06:11,982
This is a job for me, Barney.

126
00:06:12,078 --> 00:06:14,153
It's a way to make
some extra wedding money, and that's it.

127
00:06:14,249 --> 00:06:17,339
Now, I'm sorry, but I have work to do.

128
00:06:19,644 --> 00:06:22,735
Tracy, could you come in here, please?

129
00:06:24,081 --> 00:06:28,423
Would you please inform Mr. Eriksen
that I'm no longer speaking to him?

130
00:06:28,519 --> 00:06:34,293
- Mr. Eriksen, Mr. Stinson is no longer...
- I get it. Thank you, Tracy.

131
00:06:38,193 --> 00:06:39,151
Hello?

132
00:06:39,247 --> 00:06:42,915
Hello. May I speak with a Mr. Ted Mosby?

133
00:06:43,014 --> 00:06:43,971
Speaking.

134
00:06:44,067 --> 00:06:45,631
Mr. Mosby, how you doing, sir?

135
00:06:45,727 --> 00:06:48,313
Bob Rorschach over here
at Love Solutions.

136
00:06:48,409 --> 00:06:50,931
<i>You signed up for our services
about six months ago.</i>

137
00:06:51,027 --> 00:06:53,389
Yeah. You guys never found me a match.

138
00:06:53,485 --> 00:06:56,678
Right. Well, actually,
that's why I'm calling.

139
00:06:56,774 --> 00:07:00,189
<i>We found her, sir.
We found your soul mate.</i>

140
00:07:02,584 --> 00:07:04,436
I don't understand.
What happened to Ellen Pierce?

141
00:07:04,532 --> 00:07:05,745
Doesn't she run this place?

142
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:08,331
Well, my firm bought out the company.

143
00:07:08,427 --> 00:07:10,725
You know, we're a high-end meats
and textiles conglomerate,

144
00:07:10,821 --> 00:07:14,142
but the geniuses at corporate
decided they wanted to diversify,

145
00:07:14,238 --> 00:07:16,240
so here I am.

146
00:07:17,014 --> 00:07:18,928
So I'm in good hands.

147
00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:20,367
You found me a match?

148
00:07:20,463 --> 00:07:24,529
There she is. Your soul mate.
That'll be 500 bucks.

149
00:07:24,581 --> 00:07:27,518
No way. The last time I did this,
the girl turned out to be engaged.

150
00:07:27,614 --> 00:07:30,360
She's not engaged. She's your soul mate.

151
00:07:30,456 --> 00:07:32,369
Just read the file.

152
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:39,140
<i>So I read the file.
And, by God, this woman was perfect.</i>

153
00:07:39,235 --> 00:07:42,396
<i>She liked dogs.
She spent her summers in North Carolina.</i>

154
00:07:42,492 --> 00:07:45,109
<i>She played bass guitar.
She didThe Times crossword.</i>

155
00:07:45,205 --> 00:07:47,951
<i>She played tennis. She liked old movies.
Her favorite food was lasagna.</i>

156
00:07:48,047 --> 00:07:49,931
<i>Her favorite book was
Love in the Time of Cholera.</i>

157
00:07:50,027 --> 00:07:55,549
<i>Her favorite singer was Otis Redding.
And she wanted two kids, a boy and a girl.</i>

158
00:07:55,645 --> 00:07:57,841
All right, fine. Set it up.

159
00:07:58,934 --> 00:08:01,934
You wanted to see me,
so I guess that means we're talking again.

160
00:08:02,030 --> 00:08:06,910
Will you taste this latte for me?
I think they gave me decaf.

161
00:08:09,533 --> 00:08:10,682
It tastes normal to me.

162
00:08:10,778 --> 00:08:13,716
That's what I thought, too.
Then I got this e-mail from Butterfield.

163
00:08:13,811 --> 00:08:17,284
- Oh, God!
- It got me as well.

164
00:08:17,578 --> 00:08:19,973
Well, then why did you have me drink it?

165
00:08:20,069 --> 00:08:22,746
Because now you're in.

166
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:25,272
Okay.

167
00:08:25,368 --> 00:08:26,933
Don't think I'm overlooking
the obvious fact...

168
00:08:27,029 --> 00:08:29,200
that I should just be mad at you.

169
00:08:29,296 --> 00:08:34,020
But Executive Mischief Consultant
Marshall Eriksen reporting for duty.

170
00:08:34,116 --> 00:08:36,393
Let's make that bastard pay.

171
00:08:36,638 --> 00:08:38,074
You think that
we should brush our teeth first?

172
00:08:38,170 --> 00:08:40,948
- Yeah, it's probably a good idea.
- Let's go.

173
00:08:41,043 --> 00:08:44,013
<i>So, that night I had
a blind date with my perfect match.</i>

174
00:08:44,109 --> 00:08:46,025
<i>I was so excited, I got there early.</i>

175
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,525
<i>But before it even started...</i>

176
00:08:50,462 --> 00:08:51,516
Lily?

177
00:08:51,611 --> 00:08:53,367
Hey, Ted, are you busy?

178
00:08:53,463 --> 00:08:55,377
Um, yes.

179
00:08:55,858 --> 00:08:57,805
Oh, right. Soul mate. Forgot.

180
00:08:57,901 --> 00:09:00,103
Listen, could you take
a cab out to Dutchess County...

181
00:09:00,199 --> 00:09:02,147
and change a flat on Marshall's Fiero?

182
00:09:02,243 --> 00:09:03,520
<i>What?</i>

183
00:09:03,616 --> 00:09:06,788
What? No. Can't you just call Marshall?

184
00:09:06,808 --> 00:09:08,723
Marshall can't know about this.

185
00:09:08,819 --> 00:09:11,789
Look, Ted, it's dark,
I don't know how to change a tire,

186
00:09:11,885 --> 00:09:15,780
and I've stumbled into the beginning
of a very scary campfire story.

187
00:09:15,876 --> 00:09:18,205
- Can you please hurry?
- I can't. I'm waiting...

188
00:09:18,301 --> 00:09:21,622
Oh, my God,
is that a drifter with a hook for a hand?

189
00:09:21,718 --> 00:09:23,442
No, drifter, no!

190
00:09:23,538 --> 00:09:26,710
- Come on, Lily.
- But you see my point.

191
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:30,729
All right, stay there. I'm on my way.

192
00:09:33,965 --> 00:09:39,902
<i>And so, one $90 cab ride later,
I was in the middle of nowhere.</i>

193
00:09:40,757 --> 00:09:43,599
Oh, thank God. I'm so sorry about this.

194
00:09:43,695 --> 00:09:45,451
- Did you get ahold of your date?
- Yes.

195
00:09:45,546 --> 00:09:48,771
- And was she okay about pushing it back?
- Yes. Because she's perfect!

196
00:09:48,866 --> 00:09:50,304
So, what am I doing here?

197
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:52,379
- You can never tell Marshall.
- I won't.

198
00:09:52,475 --> 00:09:56,146
Ever. Swear. Swear on the lives
of your unborn boy and girl.

199
00:09:56,242 --> 00:09:58,275
I swear on Luke and Leia.

200
00:09:59,753 --> 00:10:03,413
About a month ago,
I started getting insomnia.

201
00:10:03,553 --> 00:10:07,192
<i>Marrying Marshall had been
all I wanted for a long time.</i>

202
00:10:07,288 --> 00:10:10,832
<i>But now that it was really happening,
it seemed kind of huge and scary.</i>

203
00:10:10,928 --> 00:10:13,769
<i>- Did you talk to Marshall about it?
- He wouldn't have understood.</i>

204
00:10:13,864 --> 00:10:16,419
<i>He's not exactly nervous
about tying the knot.</i>

205
00:10:20,601 --> 00:10:23,773
<i>So I spent my nights reading, painting,</i>

206
00:10:23,793 --> 00:10:25,837
<i>setting the high score
on Super Bomberman.</i>

207
00:10:25,933 --> 00:10:27,848
- <i>That was you? Awesome!
- I know!</i>

208
00:10:27,944 --> 00:10:31,808
<i>I just got in the zone and...
Not the point of the story.</i>

209
00:10:31,903 --> 00:10:33,691
<i>And then I started thinking about Victoria...</i>

210
00:10:33,786 --> 00:10:35,957
<i>and how she followed
her dream to Germany,</i>

211
00:10:36,053 --> 00:10:38,033
<i>then I found this art fellowship.</i>

212
00:10:38,128 --> 00:10:42,683
- Let me guess. It's somewhere far away.
- San Francisco.

213
00:10:43,173 --> 00:10:47,675
But it's not like I'm going to do it.
The dates conflict with the wedding.

214
00:10:47,770 --> 00:10:52,909
But I love painting,
and I've always wondered if I'm any good.

215
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:55,657
This was the way to find out.

216
00:10:55,752 --> 00:10:59,493
- And the interview is tonight.
- In New Haven.

217
00:11:03,957 --> 00:11:05,777
You don't want to get married.

218
00:11:05,873 --> 00:11:08,139
Of course I want to get married!

219
00:11:08,235 --> 00:11:11,491
I... It's not like I was ever going to do it.

220
00:11:11,587 --> 00:11:15,833
I just... I just really wanted to see
if I could get this.

221
00:11:15,929 --> 00:11:19,601
Lily, we live in the center
of art and culture in America.

222
00:11:19,697 --> 00:11:21,995
I'm sure you could find a program here
that's just as selective.

223
00:11:22,091 --> 00:11:24,293
But you chose one
in a city 3,000 miles away,

224
00:11:24,389 --> 00:11:26,209
and you didn't tell Marshall.

225
00:11:26,305 --> 00:11:29,720
I think it's pretty clear what that means.

226
00:11:30,519 --> 00:11:32,433
Okay, I...

227
00:11:32,562 --> 00:11:34,921
I was having second thoughts.

228
00:11:35,531 --> 00:11:37,469
But I'm not anymore.

229
00:11:37,798 --> 00:11:42,555
I... I mean, this flat tire was a sign.
I'm not supposed to do this.

230
00:11:42,651 --> 00:11:46,229
I'm supposed to go home
and be with Marshall.

231
00:11:47,631 --> 00:11:51,208
- You must think I'm so stupid.
- I don't think you're stupid.

232
00:11:51,303 --> 00:11:54,963
- I love Marshall.
- I know you do. Come here.

233
00:11:57,305 --> 00:11:58,646
It's okay.

234
00:11:58,742 --> 00:12:02,808
Look, marriage is big.
You're allowed to freak out.

235
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:05,134
But why am I the only one?

236
00:12:05,159 --> 00:12:07,681
How come Marshall isn't doing
anything crazy?

237
00:12:07,777 --> 00:12:12,576
So all we need is one large shipping box
and 100 white mice.

238
00:12:14,577 --> 00:12:16,491
All done.

239
00:12:18,504 --> 00:12:20,700
Ted, let's go to New Haven.

240
00:12:20,739 --> 00:12:23,342
Lily, don't do this to yourself.

241
00:12:23,389 --> 00:12:25,432
I just need to know if I can get in.

242
00:12:25,528 --> 00:12:28,401
If I do this interview,
and get into the program, then I'll know,

243
00:12:28,497 --> 00:12:30,764
and I can forget all about it,
and get married.

244
00:12:30,859 --> 00:12:32,200
Come on! It's an adventure.

245
00:12:32,296 --> 00:12:34,818
No, it's not an adventure. It's a mistake.

246
00:12:35,285 --> 00:12:38,637
Okay, yes, it's a mistake.
I know it's a mistake.

247
00:12:38,733 --> 00:12:41,638
But there are certain things in life
where you know it's a mistake,

248
00:12:41,733 --> 00:12:43,235
but you don't really know it's a mistake,

249
00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:46,140
because the only way to really know
it's a mistake is to make the mistake,

250
00:12:46,235 --> 00:12:48,470
and look back and say,
'Yep, that was a mistake.'

251
00:12:48,566 --> 00:12:51,695
So, really, the bigger mistake would be
to not make the mistake...

252
00:12:51,791 --> 00:12:53,611
because then you'd go your whole life
not really knowing...

253
00:12:53,706 --> 00:12:55,271
if something is a mistake or not.

254
00:12:55,366 --> 00:12:57,346
And, damn it, I've made no mistakes!

255
00:12:57,442 --> 00:12:58,719
I've done all of this,

256
00:12:58,815 --> 00:13:02,864
my life, my relationship,
my career, mistake-free.

257
00:13:03,762 --> 00:13:05,933
Does any of this make sense to you?

258
00:13:06,029 --> 00:13:08,584
I don't know. You said 'mistake' a lot.

259
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:10,308
Lily, don't do this.

260
00:13:10,404 --> 00:13:12,735
Ted, I'm getting married in two months,

261
00:13:12,830 --> 00:13:14,873
and I'm freaking out,
and you're my best friend,

262
00:13:14,969 --> 00:13:17,906
- and you just have to forgive me for this.
- But forgive you for what?

263
00:13:18,002 --> 00:13:20,037
Lily. Lily!

264
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:26,734
Hey, Lily, this is Ted,

265
00:13:26,831 --> 00:13:29,353
the guy you left stranded
by the side of the road.

266
00:13:29,449 --> 00:13:31,493
Just wanted to say good luck
with the interview.

267
00:13:31,589 --> 00:13:32,929
Remember to pick up some milk.

268
00:13:33,025 --> 00:13:36,766
Oh, and when I get home,
I'm going to kill you.

269
00:13:37,303 --> 00:13:40,475
And, also, I texted you the same thing.

270
00:13:47,136 --> 00:13:48,382
Hey, I need a big favor.

271
00:13:48,477 --> 00:13:49,467
Anything, bro.

272
00:13:49,562 --> 00:13:51,542
I need you to come up to Dutchess County
and pick me up.

273
00:13:51,638 --> 00:13:53,551
No.

274
00:13:53,936 --> 00:13:57,065
- It's kind of an emergency.
- What are you doing in Dutchess County?

275
00:13:57,161 --> 00:13:59,779
Apple picking. Can you just get up here?

276
00:13:59,875 --> 00:14:01,949
I wish I could help, buddy,
but I'm stuck here at work.

277
00:14:02,045 --> 00:14:03,578
We're kind of swamped.

278
00:14:03,674 --> 00:14:06,420
- Hey, is that Ted?
- Yeah. He's stuck in Dutchess County.

279
00:14:06,515 --> 00:14:07,920
Don't you have a big date tonight?

280
00:14:08,016 --> 00:14:10,569
Marshall. Hi. Yes. Yes, I do.

281
00:14:10,665 --> 00:14:13,284
So what are you doing
in Dutchess County?

282
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:17,242
Can't a brother go apple picking
without getting the third degree? Damn!

283
00:14:17,338 --> 00:14:19,190
Okay, well, hang on.
I'm coming to get you.

284
00:14:19,285 --> 00:14:21,584
- No!
- Relax, man. I'll take the Fiero.

285
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:23,876
No, no, no. Just forget it.

286
00:14:24,713 --> 00:14:27,587
A little prank. I'm not in Dutchess County.

287
00:14:27,682 --> 00:14:30,524
So, that's the prank?
That you're not in Dutchess County?

288
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:34,571
Yep. Gotcha! Classic! Gotta go.

289
00:14:37,547 --> 00:14:40,006
Hey, check it out.
This one actually looks like Butterfield.

290
00:14:42,815 --> 00:14:45,465
You know, over at the NRDC,
it's a bunch of really committed people...

291
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:49,169
who take their job of saving the Earth
very, very seriously.

292
00:14:49,264 --> 00:14:51,467
Which is great and everything, but

293
00:14:51,563 --> 00:14:54,532
I can't imagine having
this much fun over there.

294
00:14:54,627 --> 00:14:57,054
You're thinking about
coming to work here full-time?

295
00:14:57,150 --> 00:14:58,746
Maybe.

296
00:14:58,842 --> 00:15:00,471
- Don't tell Lily, okay?
- No.

297
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:03,407
- Taking off for the night.
- Thanks, Tracy.

298
00:15:03,503 --> 00:15:07,749
Are you guys planning
on punching some holes in that box?

299
00:15:07,845 --> 00:15:09,759
Of course we are.

300
00:15:11,261 --> 00:15:12,378
- Were you going to think of that?
- No.

301
00:15:12,474 --> 00:15:14,901
- That would have been bad.
- Horrible.

302
00:15:14,996 --> 00:15:19,051
<i>Luckily, there was still
one person I could call to get a ride home.</i>

303
00:15:19,147 --> 00:15:22,403
- Need a ride, cowboy?
- Sorry. I don't get in vans with strangers.

304
00:15:22,499 --> 00:15:26,102
- Too bad. I got candy.
- Candy?

305
00:15:28,661 --> 00:15:30,258
So, you're not going to tell me
what you were doing...

306
00:15:30,353 --> 00:15:32,205
by the side of a highway
in Dutchess County?

307
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:35,238
- Nope. Sworn to secrecy.
- Oh, come on.

308
00:15:35,333 --> 00:15:37,448
- I like your hat.
- Right.

309
00:15:38,271 --> 00:15:40,697
This is embarrassing. I got highlights.

310
00:15:40,793 --> 00:15:44,697
Oh, for the waiting room
of your dental practice?

311
00:15:44,847 --> 00:15:48,296
<i>- Highlights is a children's magazine.
- Yeah, I got it.</i>

312
00:15:48,391 --> 00:15:49,573
I thought it might look cool.

313
00:15:49,669 --> 00:15:53,723
Of course, my colorist took 'highlights'
to mean, 'I want to look like a tiger,'

314
00:15:53,818 --> 00:15:56,820
- hence the hat.
- Oh. I gotta see this.

315
00:15:56,916 --> 00:15:59,789
- No way.
- Please. I bet it doesn't look that bad.

316
00:15:59,885 --> 00:16:01,798
I bet it looks great!

317
00:16:03,492 --> 00:16:08,046
'So,' she says, changing the subject,
'Big date tonight.'

318
00:16:08,313 --> 00:16:10,644
How does she rate on the Mosby checklist?

319
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:13,749
Kind of amazingly. She's 28, like me.

320
00:16:13,868 --> 00:16:15,781
Wow, I'm 28.

321
00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:19,360
College-educated, check.
Plays tennis, check.

322
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:21,882
<i>Favorite book
is Love in the Time of Cholera, check.</i>

323
00:16:21,978 --> 00:16:26,776
I read that. More like,
'Love in the time of don't bothera.'

324
00:16:27,692 --> 00:16:30,151
You know, it's very rude
to wear a hat indoors. I'm just saying.

325
00:16:30,246 --> 00:16:33,503
- We're not indoors. We're in a van.
- Vans have doors. Let me see your hair.

326
00:16:33,598 --> 00:16:36,852
- Never. What else?
- She loves lasagna.

327
00:16:36,951 --> 00:16:40,431
- Barf.
- You know, I am sensing a pattern here.

328
00:16:40,527 --> 00:16:42,314
What else?

329
00:16:42,410 --> 00:16:45,124
Let's see what else.
Oh, she doesn't look like a tiger, check.

330
00:16:47,327 --> 00:16:49,306
And she's looking to get married
and have kids?

331
00:16:49,402 --> 00:16:51,987
Check and check.
She wants two kids, a boy and a girl.

332
00:16:52,083 --> 00:16:53,807
Wow.

333
00:16:53,903 --> 00:16:57,990
You know, I've been thinking about this.
I think I want to have zero kids.

334
00:16:58,085 --> 00:16:59,938
Really? You don't want kids?

335
00:17:00,033 --> 00:17:04,588
You know, Ted, not everyone
is as much of a woman as you.

336
00:17:05,291 --> 00:17:07,205
Hey. I'm driving.

337
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:13,914
Look at that. 8:56. You're early.

338
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:16,019
Hey, thanks for picking me up.

339
00:17:16,115 --> 00:17:20,968
Good luck on your date.
I hope she's everything you're looking for.

340
00:17:21,063 --> 00:17:22,977
Thanks.

341
00:17:26,075 --> 00:17:28,821
All right, you've clearly had a rough night.

342
00:17:28,917 --> 00:17:31,375
I want you to go in there
with a smile on your face,

343
00:17:31,471 --> 00:17:33,035
so here's what I'm going to do.

344
00:17:33,131 --> 00:17:34,600
You're going to show me your hair?

345
00:17:34,695 --> 00:17:36,260
Actually, I was going
to show you my breasts,

346
00:17:36,355 --> 00:17:38,470
but, sure, we can do hair.

347
00:17:47,689 --> 00:17:49,603
You just made my night.

348
00:17:51,329 --> 00:17:53,117
Go.

349
00:18:50,321 --> 00:18:53,163
Tomorrow morning,
Barney's going to send out the package,

350
00:18:53,199 --> 00:18:57,285
and Butterfield's going to be knee-deep
in angry white mice.

351
00:18:57,381 --> 00:18:59,658
- Oh, hey, dude.
- Hey, guys.

352
00:19:00,030 --> 00:19:01,944
- Hi.
- Hey.

353
00:19:02,424 --> 00:19:05,897
So, Lil, did you get the milk?

354
00:19:07,788 --> 00:19:10,433
Yeah. Yeah, I got it.

355
00:19:11,172 --> 00:19:14,670
You think you might want to drink the milk?

356
00:19:15,355 --> 00:19:17,934
No. Nope, I'm good.

357
00:19:19,026 --> 00:19:20,940
I don't need any milk.

358
00:19:23,719 --> 00:19:26,433
Look, guys, I know milk is important.

359
00:19:26,528 --> 00:19:28,968
It's got vitamin A, vitamin D.

360
00:19:29,275 --> 00:19:32,084
It's a great way to start the morning,
but Ted just had a huge date.

361
00:19:32,179 --> 00:19:35,042
- How'd it go, dude?
- I didn't go.

362
00:19:35,468 --> 00:19:36,745
What? Why?

363
00:19:36,841 --> 00:19:39,427
I changed my mind.
I don't want to meet her.

364
00:19:39,523 --> 00:19:41,475
Why? She sounds perfect.

365
00:19:41,757 --> 00:19:45,066
I don't want perfect. I want Robin.

366
00:19:46,163 --> 00:19:48,330
Oh, God, not this again.

367
00:19:48,430 --> 00:19:50,870
- Ted, it's a mistake!
- Maybe.

368
00:19:51,368 --> 00:19:53,826
But it's a mistake I have to make.

369
00:19:53,921 --> 00:19:56,348
Wrong. It's a mistake
you don't have to make.

370
00:19:56,444 --> 00:19:57,497
Look at the evidence.

371
00:19:57,593 --> 00:19:59,668
You and Robin have tried this
again and again...

372
00:19:59,764 --> 00:20:01,392
<i>Here's the thing
about mistakes.</i>

373
00:20:01,488 --> 00:20:04,201
<i>Sometimes, even when you know
something's a mistake,</i>

374
00:20:04,297 --> 00:20:05,639
<i>you gotta make it, anyway.</i>

375
00:20:06,819 --> 00:20:08,735
Sweet damn, that's a hot plate!

376
00:20:08,831 --> 00:20:11,026
Hey, is this milk any good?

377
00:20:15,982 --> 00:20:19,560
<i>Even really,
really dumb mistakes.</i>
