00:00:12,979 --> 00:00:16,425
Kids, the thing about
New Year's Eve is that it sucks.

3
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:17,796
<i>Sure it looks great on TV.</i>

4
00:00:17,892 --> 00:00:19,933
<i>But in reality,
it's always just a big letdown.</i>

5
00:00:20,029 --> 00:00:23,251
<i>But in 2005,
I attempted to do the impossible:</i>

6
00:00:23,346 --> 00:00:25,164
<i>To give my friends a great New Year's Eve.</i>

7
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:26,856
<i>I had an idea of how to do it, too,</i>

8
00:00:26,951 --> 00:00:30,446
<i>and all it cost was
half my Christmas bonus.</i>

9
00:00:37,605 --> 00:00:40,563
Yeah, that's right. A limo.

10
00:00:47,112 --> 00:00:51,067
- Oh, man, Ted, this is great.
- Okay, people, let's talk strategy.

11
00:00:51,163 --> 00:00:54,162
Last New Year's,
we went our separate ways, and it sucked.

12
00:00:54,257 --> 00:00:56,745
This year, we party together, or not at all.

13
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:58,563
Now, I sifted through
your party submissions,

14
00:00:58,659 --> 00:01:01,147
- and I narrowed them down to these five.
- Question.

15
00:01:01,243 --> 00:01:02,934
Yes, Barney,
your submissions were received,

16
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:05,837
and no, we will not be attending
any parties in your pants.

17
00:01:07,016 --> 00:01:10,462
But you enjoyed the e-vite, right?
That was an actual picture of my pants.

18
00:01:10,557 --> 00:01:11,578
Yeah.

19
00:01:11,674 --> 00:01:13,428
We will hit all five parties before midnight,

20
00:01:13,524 --> 00:01:15,087
and then narrow them down to one,

21
00:01:15,183 --> 00:01:17,352
the most awesome party in New York City,

22
00:01:17,447 --> 00:01:21,626
and that is where we will ring,
nay, rock in the new year.

23
00:01:21,722 --> 00:01:25,040
All right, and party number one,
that's where we get to meet Marybeth?

24
00:01:25,136 --> 00:01:27,401
- Marybeth?
- Oh, she works in my office.

25
00:01:27,496 --> 00:01:29,186
She seems like she might be into me.

26
00:01:29,282 --> 00:01:32,568
She's always finding reasons to hug me.
So tonight, we'll see...

27
00:01:34,864 --> 00:01:37,832
People often ask me,
'Barney, how is it that you're so psyched...

28
00:01:37,927 --> 00:01:40,990
- 'so much of the time?'
- By who? Who asks you that?

29
00:01:42,297 --> 00:01:44,654
And the answer is right here.

30
00:01:44,658 --> 00:01:47,648
My own, personal, get-psyched mix.

31
00:01:47,752 --> 00:01:49,858
Now, people often think
a good mix should rise and fall,

32
00:01:49,953 --> 00:01:54,511
but people are wrong.
It should be all rise, baby.

33
00:01:54,610 --> 00:01:57,258
Now, prepare yourselves
for an audio journey...

34
00:01:57,354 --> 00:02:00,660
into the white-hot center of adrenaline.

35
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:02,985
Bam.

36
00:02:05,792 --> 00:02:08,823
- It's working.
- I'm definitely getting psyched.

37
00:02:08,918 --> 00:02:12,204
God. I'm reaching dangerous
levels of psychage.

38
00:02:12,453 --> 00:02:14,365
Must do robot.

39
00:02:15,196 --> 00:02:17,552
- Let's do this!
- Yes! Let's!

40
00:02:17,684 --> 00:02:19,596
Oh, driver?

41
00:02:20,428 --> 00:02:22,340
Hello!

42
00:02:22,469 --> 00:02:23,745
Hey, Ranjit!

43
00:02:23,841 --> 00:02:26,010
Dude, you're driving a limo now.
That's awesome.

44
00:02:26,106 --> 00:02:28,300
I've moved up in the world.

45
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:30,220
How do you guys know each other?

46
00:02:30,316 --> 00:02:33,538
Oh, we rode in his cab one time.
It's a long story.

47
00:02:33,633 --> 00:02:34,623
Hey, what are we waiting for?

48
00:02:34,718 --> 00:02:36,824
We got five parties to hit,
and three hours to do it.

49
00:02:36,919 --> 00:02:38,196
Oh, I wish I could come with you guys,

50
00:02:38,291 --> 00:02:41,098
but Derek should be coming by
any minute to pick me up.

51
00:02:41,194 --> 00:02:43,303
<i>Oh, yeah,
Robin was spending</i>

52
00:02:43,398 --> 00:02:45,341
<i>New Year's with her boyfriend Derek.</i>

53
00:02:45,436 --> 00:02:48,691
<i>Derek. He was, like, rich,
successful, handsome.</i>

54
00:02:48,786 --> 00:02:50,698
<i>I hated that guy.</i>

55
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:52,837
Oh, I'll miss you guys. Have fun.

56
00:02:52,933 --> 00:02:53,858
- Bye.
- Happy New Year.

57
00:02:53,954 --> 00:02:55,866
- Bye.
- Here we go.

58
00:02:57,877 --> 00:03:00,908
- Oh, this kind of sucks.
- Okay, nobody get down.

59
00:03:01,003 --> 00:03:03,555
We knew this going in.
We're a man down.

60
00:03:03,651 --> 00:03:06,139
That just means were gonna have to party
that much harder.

61
00:03:06,235 --> 00:03:08,682
Ranjit. Party number one.

62
00:03:08,786 --> 00:03:11,908
- Party number one!
- Party number one!

63
00:03:16,124 --> 00:03:18,995
I can't believe we're leaving a party
that had pigs in blankets.

64
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:21,642
If you think we can beat that,
you got some brass ones.

65
00:03:21,738 --> 00:03:23,333
Hey, we've got four more parties to hit.

66
00:03:23,429 --> 00:03:26,746
If party number one turns out to be
the best, we'll just limo on back to it.

67
00:03:26,842 --> 00:03:30,223
We didn't really get a chance to meet.
I'm Lily, and this is my fiancÃ©, Marshall.

68
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:33,764
Hi. Marybeth.
It's so great to meet you guys.

69
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:37,145
- Oh, well, my word.
- Oh, hey. Well, you're friendly.

70
00:03:39,761 --> 00:03:44,514
Hello, American party friends of Barney's.

71
00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:47,321
- Oh, no.
- So, Barney, who's your new friend?

72
00:03:47,719 --> 00:03:51,352
- Natalya.
- Oh, friendly.

73
00:03:52,664 --> 00:03:55,376
- So, where are you from, Natalya?
- She... Who knows?

74
00:03:55,472 --> 00:03:59,555
The former
Soviet Republic of Drunk-off-her-ass-istan?

75
00:03:59,651 --> 00:04:02,065
Super drunk fantastic, huh?

76
00:04:03,255 --> 00:04:05,167
Isn't she awesome?

77
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:07,529
- How are your feet doing, baby?
- Oh, okay.

78
00:04:07,625 --> 00:04:11,326
I love these shoes, but
the pain-to-hotness ratio is pretty steep.

79
00:04:11,421 --> 00:04:13,622
Can we swing by the apartment
so I can change?

80
00:04:13,717 --> 00:04:15,440
Come on, Lily.
We have a tightly scheduled evening...

81
00:04:15,536 --> 00:04:18,502
of awesomeness ahead of us.
I need you to power through the pain.

82
00:04:18,598 --> 00:04:21,916
Okay, Ted, but these dogs
are really barking.

83
00:04:22,012 --> 00:04:24,659
It's true. I can hear them.
What's that, little boys? What's that?

84
00:04:24,755 --> 00:04:26,705
You wanna go for a rock?

85
00:04:29,284 --> 00:04:33,494
- Ranjit, party number two!
- Party number two!

86
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:43,288
- Party number two, not so good.
- No, let's go back to party number one.

87
00:04:43,384 --> 00:04:47,053
No, no turning back.
Ranjit, party number three.

88
00:04:47,149 --> 00:04:49,424
- Party number three!
- Yeah!

89
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:53,688
Oh, wait, wait, wait!
We have to turn around. We left Natalya.

90
00:04:53,783 --> 00:04:57,132
- Barney, none of us really liked her.
- What?

91
00:04:57,228 --> 00:05:00,317
- Sorry.
- Oh, very nice, Lily.

92
00:05:00,418 --> 00:05:02,874
You know, she is a guest in this country.

93
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:05,522
So, while you may choose
to turn your back on her,

94
00:05:05,618 --> 00:05:09,031
I choose to turn my front on her. What up.

95
00:05:10,539 --> 00:05:14,463
- I'm sorry about Barney.
- No, I'm having a great time.

96
00:05:14,558 --> 00:05:16,951
I'm really glad
that you asked me out tonight.

97
00:05:17,047 --> 00:05:18,610
Me, too. Just a sec.

98
00:05:22,533 --> 00:05:25,818
- Hey, Robin.
- Ted, Derek stood me up.

99
00:05:26,744 --> 00:05:29,328
<i>Derek. Now we had
a tight schedule to keep that night,</i>

100
00:05:29,423 --> 00:05:32,294
<i>and I was already on a date
with another girl.</i>

101
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:34,144
<i>But it was Robin.</i>

102
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,152
Ranjit, turn it around.

103
00:05:42,667 --> 00:05:45,919
Hi. Oh, God, I am so sorry about this.

104
00:05:45,988 --> 00:05:48,635
You guys had your schedule,
and I screwed it all up.

105
00:05:48,730 --> 00:05:52,144
No. This is perfect. It's meant to be.
We're all back together.

106
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,197
What happened?

107
00:05:53,293 --> 00:05:56,004
Oh, Derek's stuck in Connecticut
closing some deal.

108
00:05:56,099 --> 00:05:57,758
Who works on New Year's Eve?

109
00:05:59,321 --> 00:06:01,233
Okay, now I feel worse.

110
00:06:01,968 --> 00:06:06,357
I was really looking forward to this night.
This sucks.

111
00:06:09,657 --> 00:06:12,241
- Oh, dude, not now!
- What? She needs to get psyched!

112
00:06:12,337 --> 00:06:14,272
- Barney!
- Fine.

113
00:06:14,537 --> 00:06:16,813
Maybe I should just go home.

114
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:19,352
Barney!

115
00:06:19,386 --> 00:06:21,322
My finger slipped.

116
00:06:21,555 --> 00:06:24,937
Look, Robin. You're not going home.
Come on, it's New Year's Eve.

117
00:06:25,033 --> 00:06:27,680
Look, so your date fell through, so what?
What do you need a date for?

118
00:06:27,775 --> 00:06:32,433
Someone to kiss at midnight? Fine.
I'll kiss you at a little bit after midnight.

119
00:06:32,529 --> 00:06:34,443
- Hi, I'm Robin.
- Marybeth.

120
00:06:34,538 --> 00:06:37,377
Oh, wow, you're friendly.

121
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:41,077
I haven't eaten dinner yet.
Is there anything to eat in this thing?

122
00:06:41,173 --> 00:06:42,641
That's it. I know what you're jonesing for.

123
00:06:42,736 --> 00:06:47,612
- Ranjit, take us to Gray's Papaya.
- Oh, yes, Ted, you rock.

124
00:06:47,617 --> 00:06:50,456
We couldn't
go back for Natalya, a human being,

125
00:06:50,552 --> 00:06:53,391
- but we do have time for hot dogs?
- Yeah, we like hot dogs.

126
00:06:53,487 --> 00:06:56,389
No. No! We are already behind schedule.

127
00:06:56,485 --> 00:06:58,622
Ted, come on, we have
an hour-and-a-half before midnight,

128
00:06:58,718 --> 00:07:03,312
- and I don't wanna be kissing Ranjit.
- You don't know what you're missing.

129
00:07:03,407 --> 00:07:07,171
- Come on. It's only a 20-minute detour.
- Which is exactly how much time I need.

130
00:07:07,267 --> 00:07:10,074
- Ranjit, stop the car.
- Stopping the car.

131
00:07:10,169 --> 00:07:13,040
- Wait, baby, what are you doing?
- No, I'm going home.

132
00:07:13,136 --> 00:07:14,316
- What? No!
- No, you can't, Lily!

133
00:07:14,412 --> 00:07:17,123
I can't stay in these heels any longer,
I just can't.

134
00:07:17,219 --> 00:07:18,559
There's a cab over there,

135
00:07:18,655 --> 00:07:20,664
I'll just run back to the apartment
and change shoes.

136
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:22,132
But hot dogs.

137
00:07:22,813 --> 00:07:25,862
Oh, I know, baby, I'd love to go,
but it's two against one.

138
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:28,107
- Okay, I'll go with you.
- No, baby.

139
00:07:28,203 --> 00:07:32,286
Baby, you go with them,
and I'll meet you at party number three.

140
00:07:32,382 --> 00:07:34,965
- Are you sure?
- If I don't see you, Happy New...

141
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:38,148
Don't say that. We'll find each other.

142
00:07:40,133 --> 00:07:43,465
- We'll find each other.
- I know we will.

143
00:07:44,599 --> 00:07:45,588
Bye, Lil.

144
00:07:45,684 --> 00:07:47,596
- Bye.
- Bye.

145
00:07:48,522 --> 00:07:50,434
Hell of a woman.

146
00:07:51,202 --> 00:07:53,943
Let's go get some hot dogs!

147
00:07:59,049 --> 00:08:02,208
- Ranjit, party number three.
- Party number three.

148
00:08:02,303 --> 00:08:06,067
- Oh yeah!
- Look at us, riding around in a limo,

149
00:08:06,163 --> 00:08:09,289
eating hot dogs.
It's like we're the President.

150
00:08:09,385 --> 00:08:12,926
- Hey, I bet you're feeling better now.
- Oh, so much better.

151
00:08:13,021 --> 00:08:15,218
Guys, is that Moby?

152
00:08:16,434 --> 00:08:18,466
I think that that's Moby.

153
00:08:18,667 --> 00:08:21,188
<i>Now, kids, Moby was
a popular recording artist...</i>

154
00:08:21,283 --> 00:08:22,687
<i>when I was young.</i>

155
00:08:22,782 --> 00:08:26,419
- No way.
- That's totally Moby. That's awesome.

156
00:08:26,515 --> 00:08:28,939
Should I say something?
I should say something, right?

157
00:08:29,035 --> 00:08:30,947
Moby. Hey, Moby!

158
00:08:32,192 --> 00:08:35,542
Oh, my God, he's coming over.
Everybody be cool. Everybody be cool.

159
00:08:35,638 --> 00:08:37,550
- Hey.
- Hello.

160
00:08:37,647 --> 00:08:40,167
What's up? You going somewhere?

161
00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:43,613
Yeah, I'm just going
to this party downtown.

162
00:08:43,709 --> 00:08:45,621
You want a ride?

163
00:08:46,930 --> 00:08:48,842
Sure.

164
00:08:51,747 --> 00:08:53,659
Welcome.

165
00:08:55,862 --> 00:08:58,918
- Wow. You're friendly.
- Big fan.

166
00:08:59,116 --> 00:09:00,902
I'm Barney Stinson.

167
00:09:00,997 --> 00:09:03,510
So, what about this party?

168
00:09:03,773 --> 00:09:06,548
Oh, it's just a New Year's thing
with some friends.

169
00:09:06,644 --> 00:09:08,675
Wow. That sounds awesome.

170
00:09:11,934 --> 00:09:15,428
- You guys wanna come?
- Yeah, we'd love to.

171
00:09:15,666 --> 00:09:17,578
- All right.
- Ted.

172
00:09:17,644 --> 00:09:21,309
- Sidebar.
- Moby, switch up, will you?

173
00:09:25,905 --> 00:09:27,817
Yeah, what's up?

174
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:30,116
- What about Lily?
- Call her.

175
00:09:30,212 --> 00:09:31,999
I've been trying to call her.
I can't get through.

176
00:09:32,094 --> 00:09:34,295
- All the circuits are jammed.
- That's New Year's Eve for you.

177
00:09:34,391 --> 00:09:36,911
Well, look, we'll just swing by
Moby's party, and then, afterwards...

178
00:09:37,006 --> 00:09:40,744
No, I can't. Lily's waiting. I gotta find her.

179
00:09:41,696 --> 00:09:45,619
- Okay, I'll meet you at party number three.
- But... Come on. Moby's party.

180
00:09:45,715 --> 00:09:48,836
Moby's party. Moby's...

181
00:09:50,755 --> 00:09:54,485
- Ranjit, Moby's party.
- Moby's party.

182
00:09:58,060 --> 00:09:59,972
This is a cool mix.

183
00:10:00,069 --> 00:10:03,036
You know, people think
a great mix has to rise and fall.

184
00:10:03,131 --> 00:10:06,707
- I think it should be all rise.
- Yes. Moby.

185
00:10:06,832 --> 00:10:10,469
Yeah, it should start high, get higher.
This mix is my pride and joy.

186
00:10:10,565 --> 00:10:16,253
- I never leave home without it.
- That's how I feel about Janice here.

187
00:10:18,838 --> 00:10:22,315
So, then I said, your motorcycle
was like that when I got here.

188
00:10:28,982 --> 00:10:31,875
- You're not Moby, are you?
- Who?

189
00:10:32,810 --> 00:10:37,106
- Moby. The recording artist, Moby.
- No.

190
00:10:37,690 --> 00:10:41,510
But when we said, 'Hey, Moby,'
you said, 'Yeah.'

191
00:10:41,614 --> 00:10:43,808
I thought you said, 'Tony.'

192
00:10:44,198 --> 00:10:46,645
- So, your name is Tony?
- No.

193
00:10:48,345 --> 00:10:52,733
Oh, hey, we're here. All right.
You guys gonna come in?

194
00:10:53,257 --> 00:10:55,487
- No.
- You sure?

195
00:10:55,873 --> 00:11:00,626
Come on, it's gonna get nuts in there.
It's this dude who owes me money.

196
00:11:00,722 --> 00:11:03,081
No, we're good. We're good.

197
00:11:03,242 --> 00:11:05,273
Happy New Year, Not Moby.

198
00:11:09,207 --> 00:11:12,644
Oh, hey, hey. Be safe.

199
00:11:16,384 --> 00:11:18,904
- Why did we think that guy was Moby?
- I don't know.

200
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,573
I see a short, bald hipster,
my mind goes straight to Moby.

201
00:11:26,336 --> 00:11:28,028
That's Marshall's phone.

202
00:11:28,123 --> 00:11:30,035
Hey...

203
00:11:31,664 --> 00:11:34,950
- Hello.
- Oh, Marshall. Thank God I got through!

204
00:11:35,046 --> 00:11:38,384
- Hey, sexy.
- Barney, where's Marshall?

205
00:11:39,225 --> 00:11:41,266
He left his phone in the limo.
He's out looking for you.

206
00:11:41,361 --> 00:11:43,977
- What? Where?
- Party number three.

207
00:11:44,073 --> 00:11:46,912
Well, I'm here at party number three and...

208
00:11:47,008 --> 00:11:49,814
Oh, my God,
guess who just walked in? Moby.

209
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:51,911
Moby? She's upstairs.

210
00:11:53,036 --> 00:11:56,227
Lily, you have to get out of there
this instant. That's not Moby!

211
00:11:56,322 --> 00:12:00,629
Oh, no, I know Moby, and that's...
Does he have a gun?

212
00:12:00,756 --> 00:12:02,668
Run!

213
00:12:03,276 --> 00:12:06,817
Oh, my God.
Not Moby's party is party number four.

214
00:12:06,913 --> 00:12:08,603
What are the odds?

215
00:12:10,836 --> 00:12:11,793
Who was that guy?

216
00:12:11,889 --> 00:12:13,707
Well, we know it's not Moby,
and it's not Tony.

217
00:12:13,803 --> 00:12:15,845
- Ranjit! Drive!
- Where to?

218
00:12:15,941 --> 00:12:17,376
- Party number three!
- Party number three!

219
00:12:17,896 --> 00:12:19,808
Party number three.

220
00:12:21,206 --> 00:12:23,280
No, but I was just at party number three.

221
00:12:23,330 --> 00:12:26,680
No, no, no. You were at party number four.
You must have looked at the list wrong.

222
00:12:26,776 --> 00:12:29,424
Well, after that
rather unpsyching experience,

223
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:31,433
you know what it's time for?

224
00:12:31,529 --> 00:12:35,096
It's time to, what? That's right. Re-psych.

225
00:12:37,334 --> 00:12:39,246
Re...

226
00:12:40,684 --> 00:12:42,596
Where's the...

227
00:12:45,214 --> 00:12:48,789
Oh, my God, Not Moby took my
get-psyched mix!

228
00:12:49,106 --> 00:12:52,901
Barney, Barney, what the hell!
Barney, it's not worth it. Let it go.

229
00:12:52,997 --> 00:12:55,198
We need to get back on schedule.

230
00:12:56,346 --> 00:12:58,259
Oh, nuts.

231
00:13:03,587 --> 00:13:06,025
Ranjit, you sure I can't help?

232
00:13:06,745 --> 00:13:11,303
No. I am pissed.
Ted, I don't want you to see me pissed.

233
00:13:12,073 --> 00:13:13,985
Okay.

234
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:18,197
Okay, not a problem.
He'll jack it up, slap on a tire,

235
00:13:18,293 --> 00:13:20,686
we'll be at party number three in no time.

236
00:13:20,781 --> 00:13:23,748
I wish Marshall would call.
Guess the circuits are jammed.

237
00:13:23,844 --> 00:13:25,502
Yeah, you know
why all the circuits are jammed?

238
00:13:25,598 --> 00:13:28,406
'Cause everyone's calling their loved ones.
Everyone around the world.

239
00:13:28,501 --> 00:13:30,413
Everyone except Barney.

240
00:13:32,488 --> 00:13:36,055
Oh, sure. Laugh. Laugh for Barney Stinson.

241
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:38,039
Laugh for the sad clown...

242
00:13:38,134 --> 00:13:42,281
trapped on his whirling carousel of suits,
and cigars,

243
00:13:42,377 --> 00:13:46,115
and bimbos, and booze.
Round and round it goes.

244
00:13:46,269 --> 00:13:49,194
And where's it all heading? Nowhere.

245
00:13:50,352 --> 00:13:53,734
Is this just 'cause
you lost your get-psyched mix?

246
00:13:53,829 --> 00:13:56,221
I'm sorry.
Am I not allowed to have a pensive side?

247
00:13:56,317 --> 00:14:00,846
No. No, not tonight. Not in the limo.
We gotta stay psyched.

248
00:14:00,942 --> 00:14:06,062
Ted went to a lot of trouble
to make this an awesome New Year's.

249
00:14:19,125 --> 00:14:21,037
I'm gonna get some air.

250
00:14:29,748 --> 00:14:32,459
It'll be fine, we'll be out of here in a jiff.

251
00:14:32,555 --> 00:14:33,672
Ted, I'm gonna head out.

252
00:14:33,767 --> 00:14:35,968
My roommates are having a party
not far from here.

253
00:14:36,064 --> 00:14:37,116
What? No!

254
00:14:37,212 --> 00:14:39,445
Look, I know this night isn't turning out
the way I planned, but we...

255
00:14:39,541 --> 00:14:42,444
How long have you been in love
with Robin?

256
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:47,132
I'm not in love... We're just friends.
Where are you getting that from?

257
00:14:47,228 --> 00:14:49,360
Ted, it's okay. I'm fine.

258
00:14:50,227 --> 00:14:54,437
- And I can tell that she's into you, too.
- That's ridiculous.

259
00:14:54,533 --> 00:14:58,296
- Wait, really?
- Happy New Year, Ted.

260
00:15:14,445 --> 00:15:17,156
I can't believe
Marybeth left before midnight.

261
00:15:17,252 --> 00:15:19,516
Oh, she just had to make an appearance
at this other party.

262
00:15:19,612 --> 00:15:20,920
It's no big deal.

263
00:15:21,016 --> 00:15:23,600
The first time I rode in a limo, I was five.

264
00:15:23,695 --> 00:15:26,598
I was on the way
to my grandfather's funeral.

265
00:15:26,693 --> 00:15:29,294
I suppose, in a way, I still am.

266
00:15:30,234 --> 00:15:33,297
Okay, wow, it's getting weird in here.
I'm gonna call Marshall.

267
00:15:33,392 --> 00:15:36,236
- But he left his phone.
- Marshall!

268
00:15:37,316 --> 00:15:39,228
Marshall!

269
00:15:39,549 --> 00:15:43,441
- I'm sorry about your girl.
- Sorry about your guy.

270
00:15:43,537 --> 00:15:47,556
Well, at least we both have someone
to kiss at midnight.

271
00:15:47,651 --> 00:15:52,121
Did you forget about our little deal?
Because I did not.

272
00:15:52,405 --> 00:15:54,317
I did not, too.

273
00:15:57,540 --> 00:16:00,945
Derek. Hi, how's work?

274
00:16:01,049 --> 00:16:02,612
Give you some privacy.

275
00:16:02,708 --> 00:16:04,620
Marshall!

276
00:16:07,079 --> 00:16:08,991
- Hey.
- Hey.

277
00:16:13,713 --> 00:16:15,625
- Hey.
- Hey.

278
00:16:17,190 --> 00:16:18,913
Marshall!

279
00:16:19,009 --> 00:16:19,997
Okay, how's this for a plan?

280
00:16:20,093 --> 00:16:22,231
We start walking now,
we get to party number three by 12:45,

281
00:16:22,326 --> 00:16:24,145
we celebrate the new year
in Central Standard time.

282
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,324
Marshall!

283
00:16:25,686 --> 00:16:27,792
- Give it a rest, Ted.
- Give what a rest?

284
00:16:27,888 --> 00:16:30,312
Trying to turn this night
into anything more than what it is,

285
00:16:30,408 --> 00:16:31,524
which is New Year's Eve,

286
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:35,735
which is the single biggest letdown
of a night, every single year.

287
00:16:35,830 --> 00:16:37,521
- Marshall!
- Come on! Come on,

288
00:16:37,617 --> 00:16:39,978
we can still turn this thing around.
We've still got 10 minutes.

289
00:16:40,073 --> 00:16:43,614
Stop trying to chase down
some magical, perfect New Year's, Ted.

290
00:16:43,710 --> 00:16:45,622
It doesn't exist.

291
00:16:46,772 --> 00:16:49,632
- Marshall!
- Lily!

292
00:16:51,908 --> 00:16:54,420
- Holy crap.
- Marshall!

293
00:17:02,657 --> 00:17:04,668
I knew I'd catch up
with you guys eventually.

294
00:17:04,763 --> 00:17:08,208
So much to tell. I couldn't find Lily
at party number three, so I walked.

295
00:17:08,304 --> 00:17:09,867
I walked to the next party on the list.

296
00:17:09,962 --> 00:17:11,876
- Not Moby's party?
- Yes, Moby's party.

297
00:17:11,972 --> 00:17:14,653
Check it out, he signed my shirt.

298
00:17:17,044 --> 00:17:18,956
And guess what I found?

299
00:17:19,692 --> 00:17:22,403
Yeah, I heard it playing at the party,
so I swiped it.

300
00:17:22,499 --> 00:17:25,147
- I know. I know. Come on.
- Come on.

301
00:17:25,242 --> 00:17:27,154
Marshall.

302
00:17:28,082 --> 00:17:32,037
Baby, baby. I was so worried about you.
Why didn't you call me?

303
00:17:32,132 --> 00:17:34,972
I tried, baby, all the circuits are jammed.
But, wait, there's more.

304
00:17:35,067 --> 00:17:37,747
After party number four, I figured
you guys went to party number five.

305
00:17:37,843 --> 00:17:40,682
And so I went there, too,
and it is awesome!

306
00:17:40,778 --> 00:17:42,978
I wanna cry. It is so awesome.

307
00:17:43,074 --> 00:17:45,530
- We have to go there.
- How? We'll never get a cab.

308
00:17:45,626 --> 00:17:47,538
The flat's fixed.

309
00:17:48,114 --> 00:17:51,715
Let's do this! Come on! In! Go, go, go!

310
00:17:52,165 --> 00:17:53,346
- Go, go, go!
- Natalya?

311
00:17:53,441 --> 00:17:55,802
Yeah, it turns out she was asleep
in the front seat the whole time.

312
00:17:55,897 --> 00:17:58,290
- Ranjit, why didn't you tell me?
- I didn't want to wake her.

313
00:17:58,386 --> 00:17:59,662
She looked so peaceful.

314
00:17:59,758 --> 00:18:02,756
Party number five is 20 blocks away
and all the way across town.

315
00:18:02,851 --> 00:18:04,543
Ranjit, can you get us there
in eight minutes?

316
00:18:04,638 --> 00:18:06,751
I'll get you there in six.

317
00:18:11,241 --> 00:18:12,836
I don't think I can do it.

318
00:18:12,932 --> 00:18:14,048
- No, come on.
- No, come on.

319
00:18:14,144 --> 00:18:15,803
- Move, you stupid taxi!
- Move...

320
00:18:15,898 --> 00:18:18,004
- Three minutes! Come on!
- Come on!

321
00:18:20,301 --> 00:18:22,251
Ranjit, put her in park.

322
00:18:23,745 --> 00:18:26,776
Dudes, I'm sure
party number five is awesome.

323
00:18:26,871 --> 00:18:30,636
But it's not the best party in New York,
'cause this is.

324
00:18:30,732 --> 00:18:32,644
Right here.

325
00:18:33,188 --> 00:18:34,273
- Cheers. Well said.
- Cheers.

326
00:18:34,369 --> 00:18:35,836
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

327
00:18:35,932 --> 00:18:39,727
<i>And just like that, we were
having the perfect New Year's Eve.</i>

328
00:18:39,823 --> 00:18:43,874
<i>Funny thing is, all night long
I'd been trying to chase something down...</i>

329
00:18:43,970 --> 00:18:46,733
<i>that was right there in that limo.</i>

330
00:18:50,344 --> 00:18:52,573
Derek? Derek.

331
00:18:53,852 --> 00:18:56,179
- Hey.
- Hey. Come on in.

332
00:18:58,670 --> 00:19:00,582
Robin.

333
00:19:00,934 --> 00:19:04,539
I cut my meeting short
because I wanted to see you at midnight.

334
00:19:04,634 --> 00:19:08,535
- I can't believe you made it.
- I made it, baby.

335
00:19:10,631 --> 00:19:13,340
I super love you, okay?

336
00:19:14,077 --> 00:19:15,989
Here, you need a mint.

337
00:19:16,373 --> 00:19:18,096
Eight, seven,

338
00:19:18,192 --> 00:19:21,117
six, five, four,

339
00:19:21,222 --> 00:19:23,865
three, two, one!

340
00:19:23,965 --> 00:19:24,923
Happy New Year!

341
00:19:25,019 --> 00:19:28,463
<i>You probably wanna feel bad
for your old man at this point in the story.</i>

342
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:31,781
<i>Well, don't.
Not every night has a happy ending.</i>

343
00:19:31,876 --> 00:19:35,226
<i>But all of it's important.
All of it was leading somewhere.</i>

344
00:19:35,322 --> 00:19:37,759
<i>Because suddenly, it was 2006.</i>

345
00:19:38,416 --> 00:19:40,961
<i>And 2006 was a big one.</i>

346
00:19:41,159 --> 00:19:43,071
Ted.

347
00:19:45,625 --> 00:19:49,119
What the hell, man?
I thought we had a deal.

348
00:19:50,857 --> 00:19:54,676
What about your guy? It's midnight.
Go kiss him.

349
00:19:55,163 --> 00:19:58,576
He kept me waiting.
I can keep him waiting.

350
00:20:00,363 --> 00:20:02,275
Well, a deal is a deal.

351
00:20:13,952 --> 00:20:15,864
Happy New Year.

352
00:20:17,333 --> 00:20:19,245
Happy New Year.
