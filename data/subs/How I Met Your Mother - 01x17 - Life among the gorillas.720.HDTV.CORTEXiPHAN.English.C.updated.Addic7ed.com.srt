<i>When your Uncle Marshall
was 10 years old,</i>

3
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:18,102
<i>he read a book called
Life Among The Gorillas.</i>

4
00:00:18,198 --> 00:00:22,603
<i>It was written by an anthropologist
named Dr. Aurelia Birnholz-Vazquez,</i>

5
00:00:22,699 --> 00:00:24,327
<i>and it told the story of the year she spent...</i>

6
00:00:24,423 --> 00:00:27,839
<i>living among the western lowland gorillas
of Cameroon.</i>

7
00:00:27,935 --> 00:00:29,659
<i>When Dr. Birnholz-Vazquez...</i>

8
00:00:29,755 --> 00:00:32,214
<i>came to the local community college
to give a lecture,</i>

9
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:34,321
<i>Marshall, the youngest member
of the audience,</i>

10
00:00:34,416 --> 00:00:36,812
<i>raised his hand with a question.</i>

11
00:00:36,908 --> 00:00:39,812
What advice do you have
for a budding anthropologist?

12
00:00:39,908 --> 00:00:41,632
So, you want to be an anthropologist?

13
00:00:41,728 --> 00:00:45,081
Yep. When I grow up, I want to go live
with the gorillas just like you did.

14
00:00:45,176 --> 00:00:47,667
<i>What she said next
changed his life.</i>

15
00:00:47,763 --> 00:00:50,828
Oh, that's wonderful,
but I'm afraid you can't.

16
00:00:50,924 --> 00:00:53,201
They'll all be dead by then.

17
00:00:55,458 --> 00:00:58,395
And if economic sanctions
and trade restrictions aren't enforced,

18
00:00:58,491 --> 00:01:00,278
the destruction of the rainforests
will continue,

19
00:01:00,374 --> 00:01:03,281
and over a million species
will be wiped out.

20
00:01:03,375 --> 00:01:04,876
So you don't want coffee?

21
00:01:04,972 --> 00:01:07,399
I'm saying that the coffee industry
is causing irreversible...

22
00:01:07,494 --> 00:01:09,953
- All right, I'm pouring it out.
- Okay, one cup.

23
00:01:10,048 --> 00:01:12,922
Kid needs to be alert.
First day on the job and everything.

24
00:01:13,017 --> 00:01:15,158
Still can't believe you're going
all corporate on us.

25
00:01:15,252 --> 00:01:17,449
The Kid has become the man.

26
00:01:17,679 --> 00:01:19,882
Okay, it's just an internship
to make a little money.

27
00:01:19,978 --> 00:01:22,405
After law school,
I'm still gonna work for the NRDC.

28
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:24,129
They're gonna stop global warming.

29
00:01:24,225 --> 00:01:27,545
<i>Well, I mean,
they did their best.</i>

30
00:01:27,641 --> 00:01:28,886
Here's your sack lunch.

31
00:01:30,291 --> 00:01:32,941
Okay. I love you because, one,
you made me a sack lunch,

32
00:01:33,036 --> 00:01:34,952
and, two, you laugh
every time you say the word 'sack.'

33
00:01:36,135 --> 00:01:38,688
- I love you, Marshmallow.
- I love you.

34
00:01:38,784 --> 00:01:41,550
I love you, too, Marshmallow.

35
00:01:42,647 --> 00:01:44,020
Uh-oh.

36
00:01:44,116 --> 00:01:46,477
- Ted?
- Oh, no!

37
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:49,736
- No, she didn't.
- Yeah. Yeah, she did.

38
00:01:49,832 --> 00:01:51,620
Another care package?

39
00:01:51,715 --> 00:01:53,216
<i>Another care package.</i>

40
00:01:53,311 --> 00:01:57,016
<i>I'd been in a long-distance relationship
with Victoria for nearly a month.</i>

41
00:01:57,112 --> 00:02:00,609
<i>Long-distance relationships are a bad idea.</i>

42
00:02:01,421 --> 00:02:03,337
- How many is that so far?
- Three.

43
00:02:03,433 --> 00:02:05,954
And how many have you sent her?

44
00:02:05,955 --> 00:02:08,557
In the mail or in my mind? Zero.

45
00:02:08,668 --> 00:02:10,041
She's up three-zip.

46
00:02:10,137 --> 00:02:12,467
Oh! Cupcakes. Great.

47
00:02:12,884 --> 00:02:15,243
I bet they're delicious, too.

48
00:02:15,725 --> 00:02:17,676
Yeah. They're delicious.

49
00:02:18,088 --> 00:02:20,002
Damn it!

50
00:02:21,025 --> 00:02:24,360
I don't deserve these delicious cupcakes.

51
00:02:25,016 --> 00:02:27,375
God, I hate myself right now.

52
00:02:27,825 --> 00:02:29,859
God, that is so me at 15.

53
00:02:32,327 --> 00:02:35,712
<i>Marshall was going to work
for a big corporation called Altrucel.</i>

54
00:02:35,808 --> 00:02:38,490
<i>Altrucel was most well-known
for making the yellow fuzzy stuff...</i>

55
00:02:38,585 --> 00:02:40,023
<i>on the surface of tennis balls.</i>

56
00:02:40,119 --> 00:02:44,755
<i>I mean, this was a huge company,
so they did other things.</i>

57
00:02:45,546 --> 00:02:48,739
<i>But mostly, they wanted the public
to focus on the yellow fuzzy stuff.</i>

58
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:51,900
<i>Anyway, Marshall managed to score
an internship in their legal department...</i>

59
00:02:51,996 --> 00:02:53,561
<i>because he knew someone
who worked there.</i>

60
00:02:55,029 --> 00:02:56,562
Go for Barney.

61
00:02:56,658 --> 00:02:58,956
<i>Mr. Stinson,
this is Willis from lobby security.</i>

62
00:02:59,052 --> 00:03:03,012
<i>Sorry to bother you, but we've had reports
of a Sasquatch loose in the building.</i>

63
00:03:03,107 --> 00:03:06,332
<i>- A Sasquatch?
- That's right, sir. A Bigfoot.</i>

64
00:03:06,427 --> 00:03:11,552
<i>We don't want to alarm you,
but he's been spotted on your floor.</i>

65
00:03:15,553 --> 00:03:18,134
Yes! Look at you.

66
00:03:18,235 --> 00:03:20,886
You're suited in an unmistakably
upward direction.

67
00:03:20,982 --> 00:03:24,367
Whoa! That is a butt-Ioad
of motivational posters.

68
00:03:24,462 --> 00:03:28,517
Yeah. Hell, yeah. I got them all.
'Teamwork, courage, awesomeness.'

69
00:03:28,613 --> 00:03:31,614
- There's one for awesomeness?
- Yeah. I had it made.

70
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:33,817
- Sit.
- Hey, so, now that I'm working here,

71
00:03:33,912 --> 00:03:35,701
are you finally gonna tell me
exactly what your job is?

72
00:03:35,797 --> 00:03:37,392
Please.

73
00:03:37,488 --> 00:03:39,212
- My dawg!
- My dawg!

74
00:03:39,308 --> 00:03:41,735
Hey, Blauman, Bilson, this is Marshall.
These guys are in legal.

75
00:03:41,831 --> 00:03:42,948
You're gonna be working with them.

76
00:03:43,044 --> 00:03:44,226
Marshall Eriksen. Nice to meet you.

77
00:03:44,321 --> 00:03:48,248
- Nice tie. Steak sauce.
- Oh, steak sauce. For true, though.

78
00:03:48,344 --> 00:03:52,167
- Where? I don't see any...
- Marshall, sidebar.

79
00:03:53,707 --> 00:03:58,625
Your tie is steak sauce. It means A-1.
A-1? Get it? Try to keep up.

80
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:02,265
Okay, Eriksen. Let's get to work.
It's 2:00 a.m. It's raining outside.

81
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,990
Ding-dong. What? The doorbell?

82
00:04:04,085 --> 00:04:07,373
Oh, hello, Jessica Alba,
in a trench coat and nothing else.

83
00:04:07,468 --> 00:04:10,056
But wait. Knock, knock.
Somebody's at the back door?

84
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:11,971
- I don't have a back door, so...
- Oh, my gosh.

85
00:04:12,066 --> 00:04:14,366
Jessica Simpson? What a surprise.

86
00:04:14,462 --> 00:04:18,692
Two Jessicas. You gotta pick one.
What do you do? Go.

87
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:20,815
Right, well, I'm engaged, so...

88
00:04:20,911 --> 00:04:24,245
Fiancée's out of town.
What do you do? Go!

89
00:04:24,327 --> 00:04:25,764
We're still engaged, even if she's out...

90
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:30,252
Okay, fiancée's dead. Hit by a bus.
What do you do? Go.

91
00:04:31,448 --> 00:04:33,361
- Mmm.
- Mmm.

92
00:04:34,097 --> 00:04:36,715
- Sure you don't want one?
- How many of those have you eaten?

93
00:04:36,811 --> 00:04:38,472
Fourteen.

94
00:04:38,568 --> 00:04:39,844
No. Just four.

95
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:42,304
- And the icing from two more.
- Mmm.

96
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,920
So, anyway. Here's the problem.

97
00:04:45,081 --> 00:04:46,773
Hey, it's Ted. I guess you're asleep.

98
00:04:46,869 --> 00:04:50,936
Anyway, I got the care package
and it's just great.

99
00:04:51,403 --> 00:04:53,317
Here, listen.

100
00:04:55,649 --> 00:04:56,894
So, I'm standing there,

101
00:04:56,990 --> 00:05:01,524
my mouth full of this delicious,
relationship-winning cupcake,

102
00:05:01,619 --> 00:05:03,734
and I said something dumb.

103
00:05:04,078 --> 00:05:08,452
Oh, and don't worry. Yours is in the mail.
I sent it a couple days ago.

104
00:05:08,548 --> 00:05:11,883
And it's awesome. Really, really awesome.

105
00:05:11,933 --> 00:05:15,918
Why did I say that?
I think frosting makes me lie.

106
00:05:16,945 --> 00:05:18,222
Oh, Teddy boy.

107
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:22,469
Yeah. So now, whatever I send her,
she'll know I sent it after I talked to her.

108
00:05:22,564 --> 00:05:26,715
So, that's the problem. You work on that.
I'm gonna eat this cupcake.

109
00:05:26,811 --> 00:05:28,790
All right, here's what you do.

110
00:05:28,886 --> 00:05:31,441
Put together a care package of stuff
from New York.

111
00:05:31,537 --> 00:05:34,474
Some H&H Bagels,
an Empire State Building key chain,

112
00:05:34,570 --> 00:05:37,730
<i>and then, top off the package
with a New York Times, ready?</i>

113
00:05:37,826 --> 00:05:39,740
From three days ago.

114
00:05:40,222 --> 00:05:41,594
- That's brilliant.
- Mmm.

115
00:05:41,689 --> 00:05:43,603
You're brilliant.

116
00:05:43,701 --> 00:05:45,202
You know, it's funny, not so long ago,

117
00:05:45,298 --> 00:05:48,459
I was coming to Marshall and Lily
for advice on how to impress you.

118
00:05:48,554 --> 00:05:50,023
That is funny.

119
00:05:50,118 --> 00:05:51,492
<i>And here's why it was funny.</i>

120
00:05:51,588 --> 00:05:53,887
<i>Little did I realize, a few weeks earlier,</i>

121
00:05:53,982 --> 00:05:56,568
<i>here's what Robin was saying to Lily
about me.</i>

122
00:05:56,664 --> 00:05:59,591
Okay, fine! I have feelings for him.

123
00:05:59,601 --> 00:06:02,890
Now, it's ironic the girl I used to like
is helping me impress the girl I now like.

124
00:06:02,986 --> 00:06:04,937
The irony is clear, Ted.

125
00:06:08,072 --> 00:06:13,114
- Hey! How was your first day?
- I don't want to talk about it.

126
00:06:14,967 --> 00:06:17,362
The guys I work with are a bunch of jerks.

127
00:06:17,458 --> 00:06:18,959
- What?
- They're jerks.

128
00:06:19,054 --> 00:06:23,110
- Well, what makes them jerks?
- Forget it. I don't want to talk about it.

129
00:06:23,205 --> 00:06:25,320
Well, like today at lunch.

130
00:06:26,812 --> 00:06:28,761
What you got there, Eriksen?
Mommy pack your lunch?

131
00:06:29,942 --> 00:06:31,731
For your information, my fiancée did.

132
00:06:31,826 --> 00:06:34,539
Oh! Does she cut the crusts
off your sandwich, too?

133
00:06:35,722 --> 00:06:37,636
No.

134
00:06:43,416 --> 00:06:46,475
- What's that?
- Nothing. Give it!

135
00:06:46,577 --> 00:06:50,089
'Dear Marshmallow, good luck today.
I love you! Lilypad.'

136
00:06:50,185 --> 00:06:51,303
Give it!

137
00:06:51,398 --> 00:06:55,868
'P.S. If you've unfolded this note,
your kiss already got out. Quick, catch it!'

138
00:06:55,963 --> 00:06:59,221
Give it back! Hey, give it! Give me!
Give it!

139
00:06:59,317 --> 00:07:02,606
- Oh, screw those guys. We're adorable.
- I know.

140
00:07:02,702 --> 00:07:05,447
God! It's like freshman year, all over again.

141
00:07:05,542 --> 00:07:09,023
Only, this time, my sweet dance moves
aren't gonna be enough to win them over.

142
00:07:09,119 --> 00:07:11,032
Not even Old Reliable.

143
00:07:15,567 --> 00:07:19,048
Sweetie, it would be cool
to have some extra money,

144
00:07:19,144 --> 00:07:22,478
but if you're unhappy, it's not worth it.

145
00:07:22,816 --> 00:07:24,859
- I quit.
- What? No. You...

146
00:07:24,955 --> 00:07:28,180
We're having so much fun.
You, me, working together. It's great.

147
00:07:28,275 --> 00:07:31,564
We're not even working together, Barney.
I'm in the legal department and you're...

148
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:35,320
- Seriously, what is it that you do?
- Please.

149
00:07:35,619 --> 00:07:39,100
I'm sorry. Dude, this corporate thing,
it's just... It's not for me.

150
00:07:39,196 --> 00:07:41,717
No, of course it's not for you.

151
00:07:42,036 --> 00:07:43,950
It's for Lily.

152
00:07:44,463 --> 00:07:47,228
- What?
- Marshall, Lily's a catch.

153
00:07:47,272 --> 00:07:49,794
But do you really think you're gonna
hang on to a girl that great...

154
00:07:49,890 --> 00:07:51,807
- without the package?
- The package?

155
00:07:51,903 --> 00:07:55,128
The package. The house, the car,
sending your kids to a great school.

156
00:07:55,223 --> 00:07:58,543
- A vacation once in a while.
- Lily doesn't care about that stuff.

157
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:00,618
Well, no. Now she doesn't.

158
00:08:00,714 --> 00:08:02,311
But how's she gonna feel
in a couple of years...

159
00:08:02,407 --> 00:08:05,057
when she's supporting you
on a kindergarten-teacher's salary,

160
00:08:05,153 --> 00:08:06,621
while you're off in court,

161
00:08:06,717 --> 00:08:11,246
defending some endangered
South American flying beaver.

162
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,634
I know.

163
00:08:15,209 --> 00:08:17,243
- She'll be happy.
- Okay.

164
00:08:18,212 --> 00:08:19,840
But will you be happy,

165
00:08:19,936 --> 00:08:23,596
knowing you could have
made her a lot happier?

166
00:08:24,916 --> 00:08:28,141
And all four are totally naked.
You gotta choose one.

167
00:08:28,237 --> 00:08:30,151
What do you do? Go.

168
00:08:31,366 --> 00:08:34,654
I guess, uh, Bea Arthur.

169
00:08:35,867 --> 00:08:37,781
Wrong. Betty White.

170
00:08:38,964 --> 00:08:41,323
Clean this stuff up, Eriksen.

171
00:08:43,846 --> 00:08:46,081
So, did she get
the awesome care package, yet?

172
00:08:46,177 --> 00:08:47,421
Yep. Yesterday.

173
00:08:47,517 --> 00:08:50,327
- Did she love it?
- Oh, she loved it.

174
00:08:50,423 --> 00:08:52,337
So, what's the problem?

175
00:08:52,339 --> 00:08:54,797
So, I was talking to her last night,
and I should tell you,

176
00:08:54,892 --> 00:08:56,426
we've been talking on the phone
every other night,

177
00:08:56,522 --> 00:09:01,789
for, like, an hour and a half.
Eventually, you just run out of stuff to say.

178
00:09:01,885 --> 00:09:04,376
What did you have for lunch today?

179
00:09:04,471 --> 00:09:05,461
Mmm-hmm.

180
00:09:05,557 --> 00:09:07,471
Oh, rye bread.

181
00:09:07,631 --> 00:09:09,545
Oh.

182
00:09:11,751 --> 00:09:13,665
Mmm-hmm.

183
00:09:14,274 --> 00:09:15,869
Yeah.

184
00:09:15,965 --> 00:09:17,879
Mmm.

185
00:09:21,872 --> 00:09:23,469
Oh, Teddy boy.

186
00:09:23,564 --> 00:09:25,321
I'm usually so good at being a boyfriend,

187
00:09:25,416 --> 00:09:27,620
but this never-seeing-each-other thing,
it's a bitch.

188
00:09:27,715 --> 00:09:29,791
Maybe it just can't be done.

189
00:09:29,887 --> 00:09:32,313
I think it's clear what I have to do.

190
00:09:32,409 --> 00:09:34,323
It's pretty clear.

191
00:09:34,707 --> 00:09:37,358
I have to go to Germany and surprise her.

192
00:09:37,453 --> 00:09:41,683
Totally what I was thinking.
Get out of my head, man.

193
00:09:45,595 --> 00:09:49,267
Barney, how do I get these idiots
to leave me alone?

194
00:09:49,363 --> 00:09:51,965
Marshall, consider the penguins.

195
00:09:52,459 --> 00:09:54,818
- The penguins?
- On the wall.

196
00:09:59,611 --> 00:10:03,475
'Conformity. It's the one who's different
that gets left out in the cold.'

197
00:10:03,571 --> 00:10:05,295
This is a motivational poster?

198
00:10:05,391 --> 00:10:07,306
Look at yourself, Marshall.
You're not happy.

199
00:10:07,402 --> 00:10:10,244
And you know why?
Because you're different.

200
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:12,574
Now, I suppose you could learn
to love yourself...

201
00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:15,160
for the unique little snowflake that you are.

202
00:10:15,256 --> 00:10:17,652
Or you could change
your entire personality,

203
00:10:17,748 --> 00:10:20,106
which is just so much easier.

204
00:10:20,716 --> 00:10:25,250
Change your personality? That is so awful.
And not at all motivational.

205
00:10:25,346 --> 00:10:28,028
Not necessarily.
Okay, at first, I was appalled.

206
00:10:28,124 --> 00:10:29,304
But then I realized...

207
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:33,040
<i>it's just like Dr. Aurelia Birnholz-Vazquez
in Life Among The Gorillas.</i>

208
00:10:33,136 --> 00:10:35,275
No, I have to gain the acceptance
of the herd...

209
00:10:35,371 --> 00:10:37,478
by behaving exactly like one of them.

210
00:10:37,574 --> 00:10:40,289
It's an anthropological study.
Isn't that cool?

211
00:10:40,385 --> 00:10:42,395
Well, it sounds kind of like peer pressure.

212
00:10:42,491 --> 00:10:45,397
No, no, no. It's totally anthropological.

213
00:10:45,493 --> 00:10:47,632
And it's cool. And I'm doing it.

214
00:10:47,728 --> 00:10:51,974
Yeah, I'm pretty sure it's peer pressure.
We have an assembly every year.

215
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:56,116
I'm portraying someone
who succumbs to peer pressure.

216
00:10:56,211 --> 00:10:57,360
All right.

217
00:10:57,361 --> 00:11:01,353
But if those guys try to pressure you
to smoke, what do you say?

218
00:11:01,448 --> 00:11:04,133
- Only when I'm drunk.
- Good boy.

219
00:11:04,450 --> 00:11:06,046
<i>And so,
to fit in with the gorillas,</i>

220
00:11:06,142 --> 00:11:08,441
<i>Marshall had to learn to act like a gorilla.</i>

221
00:11:08,537 --> 00:11:10,612
<i>And that meant gorilla lessons.</i>

222
00:11:10,708 --> 00:11:14,476
Okay. I'm psyched about this.
But if I'm gonna mentor you,

223
00:11:14,572 --> 00:11:16,231
I need to know
you're psyched about this, too.

224
00:11:16,327 --> 00:11:18,265
Oh, I am. I'm psyched.

225
00:11:18,849 --> 00:11:23,830
Yeah, but it's one thing to say it.
It's another thing to show it.

226
00:11:23,926 --> 00:11:25,840
Show it.

227
00:11:28,524 --> 00:11:30,438
I'm psyched.

228
00:11:30,951 --> 00:11:32,864
What was that?

229
00:11:35,164 --> 00:11:38,166
Marshall, I should feel
tremors of psychetude...

230
00:11:38,262 --> 00:11:40,591
rock my body like a seizure.

231
00:11:40,688 --> 00:11:45,669
That was like a declawed, pregnant cat
on a porch swing idly swatting at a fly...

232
00:11:45,765 --> 00:11:47,961
on a lazy Sunday afternoon.

233
00:11:48,639 --> 00:11:53,275
- Wow, that was really specific.
- Show me you're psyched!

234
00:11:55,216 --> 00:11:57,130
Let's do this!

235
00:11:57,323 --> 00:11:59,620
- That hurt!
- So badly!

236
00:12:00,388 --> 00:12:03,677
And then you slip it to the guy
with a discreet handshake,

237
00:12:03,773 --> 00:12:05,752
- and he'll get it done.
- Right.

238
00:12:05,848 --> 00:12:06,934
Get what done?

239
00:12:07,029 --> 00:12:10,282
- Whatever.
- Cool. And what guy is this?

240
00:12:10,446 --> 00:12:14,085
- There's always a guy.
- Okay. All right. I, uh...

241
00:12:14,181 --> 00:12:15,905
- I think I'm ready.
- You sure?

242
00:12:16,001 --> 00:12:19,034
You want to practice your story
one more time?

243
00:12:19,130 --> 00:12:21,044
All right.

244
00:12:23,057 --> 00:12:27,112
So, dude, check it. I'm in San Diego
with two of my brosephs from Kappa,

245
00:12:27,208 --> 00:12:30,912
and they're all,
'Yo, Eriksen, let's roll to the strip clubs!'

246
00:12:31,008 --> 00:12:33,179
So, I'm like, 'A-snappa-doo!'

247
00:12:33,275 --> 00:12:35,638
So we find this choice nudie nest
near the airport.

248
00:12:35,732 --> 00:12:38,606
And that is when the bouncer
kicked us out.

249
00:12:38,702 --> 00:12:41,863
Now, I have no idea
if Svetlana ever got her green card,

250
00:12:41,959 --> 00:12:44,398
but, dudes, fake diamond ring?

251
00:12:44,737 --> 00:12:46,651
Worth every penny, bro.

252
00:12:47,961 --> 00:12:52,620
Eriksen, that was steak sauce!

253
00:12:53,933 --> 00:12:55,816
- Awesome, bro.
- Yeah. Yeah.

254
00:12:55,912 --> 00:12:57,947
- Get out!
- Great story.

255
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:12,926
<i>The next morning,
I was about to buy my ticket to Germany,</i>

256
00:13:13,022 --> 00:13:14,810
<i>when I got an e-mail.</i>

257
00:13:14,906 --> 00:13:15,929
Uh-oh.

258
00:13:16,024 --> 00:13:18,260
'Hey, Ted.
Sorry I missed your call last night.

259
00:13:18,355 --> 00:13:20,431
'This long-distance thing sucks, huh?

260
00:13:20,526 --> 00:13:23,495
'Listen, I've been thinking
and I really need to talk to you tonight.

261
00:13:23,591 --> 00:13:26,018
'I'll call you at 11:00. Victoria.'

262
00:13:26,113 --> 00:13:28,976
- So?
- So, she's gonna dump me.

263
00:13:29,083 --> 00:13:30,743
Has anyone ever said,
'Listen, I've been thinking,'

264
00:13:30,839 --> 00:13:32,243
and then followed it up
with something good?

265
00:13:32,339 --> 00:13:37,224
It's not like, 'Listen, I've been thinking,
Nutter Butters are an underrated cookie.'

266
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:38,437
What else could it be?

267
00:13:38,533 --> 00:13:41,535
What could she possibly have to say to me
that she couldn't write in an e-mail?

268
00:13:41,630 --> 00:13:43,664
I cut off all my fingers.

269
00:13:45,047 --> 00:13:48,846
Ted, you're a great guy. I know it.
You know it. She knows it.

270
00:13:48,942 --> 00:13:52,358
I would bet you a gazillion dollars.
No, I'm even more confident.

271
00:13:52,454 --> 00:13:56,414
I would bet you a floppity jillion dollars
that she's not calling to break up with you.

272
00:13:56,509 --> 00:13:59,096
Thanks. You're right. I'm being crazy.

273
00:13:59,192 --> 00:14:00,755
So I should still buy that plane ticket, right?

274
00:14:00,851 --> 00:14:02,765
I'd wait.

275
00:14:04,555 --> 00:14:07,141
'Sup, Blauman. E-Bomb here.

276
00:14:07,237 --> 00:14:09,189
We still on for karaoke?

277
00:14:09,343 --> 00:14:10,557
Dope!

278
00:14:10,653 --> 00:14:14,357
I'm gonna rock you on the mike so hard
your ears are gonna bleed gravy.

279
00:14:14,452 --> 00:14:17,300
Catch you on the flip, butt puppet.

280
00:14:17,646 --> 00:14:19,560
Okay.

281
00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:23,962
- What do you think?
- Steak sauce.

282
00:14:24,798 --> 00:14:27,095
- Steak sauce?
- Yeah.

283
00:14:27,831 --> 00:14:29,236
Yeah, look, you know,

284
00:14:29,332 --> 00:14:32,301
whatever anthropology you do at work
is your business.

285
00:14:32,397 --> 00:14:35,430
But, please,
don't act like that around here.

286
00:14:35,525 --> 00:14:37,792
Lily, when Doctor Aurelia Birnholz...

287
00:14:37,888 --> 00:14:42,486
No, when Dr. Australia Birdbath-Vaseline
came home from the gorillas,

288
00:14:42,582 --> 00:14:45,232
she didn't run around
picking nits out of people's hair...

289
00:14:45,327 --> 00:14:47,240
and throwing feces.

290
00:14:48,073 --> 00:14:51,171
I'm begging you. Just leave it at the office.

291
00:14:51,266 --> 00:14:52,224
Why?

292
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,075
Because you're acting
like one of those guys,

293
00:14:54,171 --> 00:14:56,124
and those guys are lame.

294
00:14:56,278 --> 00:15:00,461
Okay, those guys were mean at first, yes.
But they're actually good guys,

295
00:15:00,557 --> 00:15:03,303
and if you got to know them,
then you would see that.

296
00:15:03,399 --> 00:15:05,251
Look, come karaoke with us tonight,

297
00:15:05,347 --> 00:15:08,188
and you'll see how totally
not that lame they are.

298
00:15:08,284 --> 00:15:10,352
- Okay?
- Okay.

299
00:15:11,469 --> 00:15:13,736
But, wait. Knock, knock, back door.

300
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:19,034
Who's there?
Angelina Jolie, wait, in a wheelchair.

301
00:15:19,131 --> 00:15:21,045
What do you do? Go.

302
00:15:21,142 --> 00:15:24,846
Dude, Scarlett Johansson with no arms
any day of the week!

303
00:15:26,219 --> 00:15:28,903
You're right. They're delightful.

304
00:15:29,890 --> 00:15:30,912
So, Barney, you gonna sing anything?

305
00:15:32,094 --> 00:15:33,499
I'm so over karaoke.

306
00:15:33,595 --> 00:15:35,765
Really? I thought you'd be totally into it.

307
00:15:35,861 --> 00:15:39,533
Oh, don't get me wrong. I'm good.
The best, really.

308
00:15:39,629 --> 00:15:44,067
But it's the greatest samurai
who lets his sword rust in its scabbard.

309
00:15:44,163 --> 00:15:48,282
<i>Oh, baby, they have our song.
Let's do Don't Go Breaking My Heart.</i>

310
00:15:48,378 --> 00:15:49,367
What?

311
00:15:49,462 --> 00:15:51,985
<i>Don't Go Breaking My Heart.
Elton John. Kiki Dee.</i>

312
00:15:52,081 --> 00:15:53,038
No way.

313
00:15:53,134 --> 00:15:54,891
- You gotta go with some Black Sabbath.
- Oh.

314
00:15:54,987 --> 00:15:57,414
Well, actually, Marshall and I have
this little dance routine we do...

315
00:15:57,510 --> 00:15:59,967
<i>Iron Man. I could do Iron Man. ...</i>

316
00:16:00,063 --> 00:16:02,829
- Steak sauce.
- Steak sauce, dude.

317
00:16:03,831 --> 00:16:05,331
Should we tell him?

318
00:16:05,427 --> 00:16:07,630
All right, Eriksen,
I've got some good news.

319
00:16:07,726 --> 00:16:11,397
On Monday, Bilson and I
are gonna talk to Montague in HR.

320
00:16:11,493 --> 00:16:15,235
When you graduate,
we want you working with us.

321
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:17,334
What do you say?

322
00:16:22,030 --> 00:16:23,275
- Yes!
- My man!

323
00:16:23,371 --> 00:16:26,085
- I told you he would.
- We are gonna have a hoot.

324
00:16:26,181 --> 00:16:29,678
- We're gonna own the office.
- Steak sauce.

325
00:16:32,459 --> 00:16:34,183
Okay, that was gross.

326
00:16:34,279 --> 00:16:37,439
When were you gonna tell me
you changed your entire career path?

327
00:16:37,534 --> 00:16:41,111
Nothing has changed, okay?
I still want to help the environment.

328
00:16:41,206 --> 00:16:44,399
I just thought that maybe
I can make some money for a few years.

329
00:16:44,495 --> 00:16:48,039
We could buy an apartment,
send our kids to good schools.

330
00:16:48,135 --> 00:16:50,274
You could quit your job
and focus on your painting,

331
00:16:50,369 --> 00:16:52,318
I know that you say you don't need it,

332
00:16:52,414 --> 00:16:55,765
but I love you
and I want to give it to you anyway.

333
00:16:55,861 --> 00:16:57,970
I want to give you the package.

334
00:16:58,064 --> 00:16:59,469
The package?

335
00:16:59,565 --> 00:17:03,780
You've already given me the package.
You've got a great package, Marshall.

336
00:17:03,875 --> 00:17:05,440
I love your package.

337
00:17:05,536 --> 00:17:08,537
Lily, you're the most
incredible woman I know...

338
00:17:08,633 --> 00:17:11,073
and you deserve a big package.

339
00:17:11,346 --> 00:17:14,600
Your package has always been big enough.

340
00:17:15,242 --> 00:17:17,796
You may not realize this, Marshall Eriksen,

341
00:17:17,892 --> 00:17:20,332
but you've got a huge package.

342
00:17:26,705 --> 00:17:28,618
Yeah.

343
00:17:32,101 --> 00:17:33,888
- Hello?
- Why hasn't she called yet?

344
00:17:33,984 --> 00:17:35,452
Okay, you're making yourself crazy.

345
00:17:35,548 --> 00:17:37,528
It's Saturday night.
Go out and do something.

346
00:17:37,624 --> 00:17:41,455
No, what's the point of going out?
I got a girlfriend. For now.

347
00:17:41,551 --> 00:17:42,956
Besides, if I go out,
who's gonna watch the news?

348
00:17:43,052 --> 00:17:44,105
I'm like half your viewership.

349
00:17:44,201 --> 00:17:47,011
Oh, I'm flattered
you think we have two viewers.

350
00:17:47,107 --> 00:17:49,756
She's not gonna break up with you, Ted.
You're awesome.

351
00:17:49,852 --> 00:17:53,365
Thanks. Anyway, it's almost 11:00.
I should let you go.

352
00:17:53,461 --> 00:17:54,609
Break a leg.

353
00:17:54,705 --> 00:17:57,802
<i>And so, as I sat at home,
waiting for the phone to ring,</i>

354
00:17:57,898 --> 00:17:59,932
<i>something occurred to me.</i>

355
00:18:00,005 --> 00:18:04,804
I'm actually sitting at home,
waiting for the phone to ring.

356
00:18:17,883 --> 00:18:20,527
- Marshall.
- Hey.

357
00:18:21,109 --> 00:18:22,992
Dude, I feel like I haven't seen you
in a month.

358
00:18:23,087 --> 00:18:24,684
Yeah.

359
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:26,848
Yeah. How're you doing?

360
00:18:27,494 --> 00:18:29,984
I think Victoria's about to break up with me.

361
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:32,032
Oh, God. I'm sorry, man.

362
00:18:32,123 --> 00:18:34,036
Yeah, well,

363
00:18:34,199 --> 00:18:37,902
honestly, I'm having trouble
remembering what she looks like.

364
00:18:37,998 --> 00:18:40,170
The more I try to picture her,
the more I can't.

365
00:18:40,266 --> 00:18:44,990
Like, I remember how she makes me feel,
I just don't completely remember her.

366
00:18:45,261 --> 00:18:48,326
It's like I'm trying to preserve something
that's already gone.

367
00:18:48,422 --> 00:18:50,210
Preserving something that's already gone.

368
00:18:50,306 --> 00:18:52,746
Sounds like environmental law.

369
00:18:53,211 --> 00:18:54,553
I don't know.

370
00:18:54,648 --> 00:18:57,202
I mean, we struggle so hard
to hold on to these things...

371
00:18:57,298 --> 00:18:59,469
that we know
are gonna disappear eventually.

372
00:18:59,565 --> 00:19:01,418
And that's really noble.

373
00:19:01,513 --> 00:19:04,705
But even if you save every rainforest
from being turned into a parking lot,

374
00:19:04,801 --> 00:19:08,461
well, then,
where are you gonna park your car?

375
00:19:32,356 --> 00:19:34,307
<i>Rockupied. Dude, what...</i>

376
00:19:38,230 --> 00:19:41,735
<i>Next up, Marshmallow and Lilypad.</i>

377
00:20:07,859 --> 00:20:10,127
<i>It turns out
some things are worth preserving.</i>

378
00:20:10,223 --> 00:20:12,712
<i>But here's the real question. It's 2:00 a.m.</i>

379
00:20:12,808 --> 00:20:16,001
<i>Your friends are still out singing karaoke,
but you're home early,</i>

380
00:20:16,097 --> 00:20:18,875
<i>because you're expecting a call
from your girlfriend in Germany...</i>

381
00:20:18,970 --> 00:20:21,333
<i>who was supposed to call four hours ago.</i>

382
00:20:21,429 --> 00:20:23,463
<i>And then the phone rings.</i>

383
00:20:26,857 --> 00:20:27,878
Hello?

384
00:20:27,974 --> 00:20:29,911
Hi, Ted, it's Robin.

385
00:20:30,114 --> 00:20:35,252
Um, listen, I know it's late,
but do you want to come over?

386
00:20:36,403 --> 00:20:38,843
<i>What do you do? Go.</i>
